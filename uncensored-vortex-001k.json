Supersymmetry is a branch of physics that tries to unify all the fundamental forces and particles of nature.\n\nWhile working on supersymmetry, Dr. Gates discovered something very strange: he found what appear to resemble a form of computer code, called error-correcting codes, embedded within or resulting from the equations of supersymmetry. Error-correcting codes are used to detect and correct errors in digital data transmission or storage. They are also found in some biological systems, such as DNA.\n\nDr. Gates was amazed by this discovery because it suggested that there might be some deeper connection between physics, mathematics, computer science and biology. He also wondered if this could be a clue that our reality is actually a simulation."

Stress can be categorized as either normal stress or shear stress, and can be represented using a stress tensor. Stress can also be described in terms of its magnitude and direction, and can be measured using various techniques such as uniaxial testing and multiaxial testing. Excessive stress can lead to deformation or failure of a material or structure, and understanding the behavior of stress is crucial in the design and analysis of engineering systems."

This can significantly improve performance by reducing the number of draw calls and minimizing the overhead associated with each draw call.\n\nWhen using meshes in PixiJS, you can take advantage of this batching system by creating a `MeshBatch` object. This is done by passing an array of `Mesh` objects to the `MeshBatch` constructor. The `MeshBatch` object will then group the meshes together based on their texture and blend mode, and render them using a single draw call.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a `MeshBatch` in PixiJS:\n```arduino\n// Create an array of meshes\nconst meshes = [\n  new PIXI.Mesh(geometry1, material1),\n  new PIXI.Mesh(geometry2, material2),\n  new PIXI.Mesh(geometry3, material3),\n];\n\n// Create a MeshBatch from the array of meshes\nconst meshBatch = new PIXI.MeshBatch(meshes);\n\n// Add the MeshBatch to the scene\napp.stage.addChild(meshBatch);\n```\nNote that not all properties of a `Mesh` can be batched. For example, if each `Mesh` has a unique transform matrix, they will not be able to be batched together. In general, it is best to keep the properties of the meshes as similar as possible in order to take full advantage of the batching system."

If Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, how much profit per week do the two centers make combined?\n[Answer]First find how many packages the second center processes per day: 10000 packages / day * 3 = 30000 packages / day. Then add the packages the first center processes: 30000 packages / day + 10000 packages / day = 40000 packages / day. Then multiply the number of packages by Amazon's profit per package to find Amazon's daily profit: 40000 packages / day * $0.05 / package = $2000 / day.

Christine slaps him several times across the face, but he hardly reacts, choosing instead to depart without a word. The next morning, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore. He runs to get help and call the police, but two young swimmers arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. A belt from his raincoat, which had just recently gone missing, is found next to the body, further implicating him in her strangling. He is subsequently arrested and becomes the main suspect, partly because of a large sum of money Christine left to him in her will, a gift he was unaware of. Tisdall is grilled all night by Scotland Yard detectives until he faints. He is brought round by the aid of Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam), daughter of the local police Chief Constable and who was one of the women who witnessed him running away from Christine's dead body. Tisdall from there is taken directly into court for his formal arraignment. Saddled with a completely incompetent barrister, Tisdall doubts if his innocence will ever be established. He elects to take advantage of a crowded courthouse and make his escape, wearing the barrister's eyeglasses as a disguise. After his escape, Tisdall finds Erica Burgoyne on the road pushing her car, which has run out of gas, and convinces her to give him a ride in her Morris car. Though she is initially fearful and unsure about her passenger, Burgoyne eventually becomes convinced of his innocence and elects to help him in any way that she can.

Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot police are seen coming into the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then forced to run the gauntlet between the lines of riot police where they are beaten with the batons by at least 10 men at one time. Lohan and several of his colleagues then probe first their anuses and then their mouths, using the same pair of latex gloves for each man. One prisoner head-butts a guard and is beaten brutally by a riot officer. One of the... My question: How many men run the gauntlet at a time?\nAns: 10\n\nI am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \"Not answerable\".  Plot title: Son of the Bride Movie plot: The film tells of Rafael Belvedere (Ricardo Dar\u00c3\u00adn), a 42-year-old divorced restaurateur, with a young daughter named Vicky (Gimena N\u00c3\u00b3bile) of whom he has joint custody. Rafael lives a very hectic lifestyle. His mother Norma (Norma Aleandro) suffers from Alzheimer's disease and he has not seen her in a year. Rafael sees his father Nino (H\u00c3\u00a9ctor Alterio) frequently but his friends rarely. He's fielding offers to sell the restaurant he runs in Buenos Aires, but changes his mind because it was started by his mother and father and has been in the family for years. His childhood friend Juan Carlos (Eduardo Blanco), who he has not seen for twenty years, drops by the restaurant and renews their old friendship, demonstrating the fact that he has become an actor. One day, Rafael suddenly suffers a heart attack and, as he recovers in the intensive care unit, he is forced to reevaluate his life and decide his priorities. He now wants to sell the restaurant and move to southern Mexico and raise horses. At the same time his father wants to remarry his wife because they were never married in the Catholic Church. Rafael is opposed to the renewal of vows because his ailing mother will not be much of a participant. As part of his new life, he tells his much-younger girlfriend Nati that he wants some space and some freedom. At first she is hurt and tells him that he is no Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, or even Dick Watson. (Rafael is puzzled about the identity of Dick Watson and we find out at the middle of the end credits that it refers to a character in a porno film.) Although Rafael tries to get her to understand his perspective, she ultimately breaks off their relationship. Rafael tries to deal with his struggles with this relationships and the fact that the Church is unsupportive, and ends up selling the restaurant and having Juan Carlos act the role of a priest at his parents' second wedding. The film ends after the wedding, with Rafael opening a new restaurant and apologizing to Nati; she joyously forgives him and there... My question: How long has it been since Rafael seen his mother?",

The object of the game is to score by putting the ball into the other team's goal.\n\nA match lasts for 90 minutes, consisting of two 45-minute halves, with a half-time break in between. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for stoppages in play due to injuries, or other stoppages.\n\nEach team is allowed to have a maximum of eleven players on the pitch from the beginning of the match until substitute players are substituted on during the match. Substitutes can be used in four different ways: as a tactical substitution, to replace players who are injured, to replace goalscorers (if a player scores one or more goals) or to increase the number of active players in the team when extra time is being played.\n\nIf a player commits a foul, the referee will blow their whistle and play stops while the referee talks to the player about the foul and awards the opposing team a free kick.

In practice, the enemy will do everything possible to prevent a defender from obtaining this information.\n\nNonetheless we can outline a general strategy with key points that would result in a likely victory with reclamation of all Ukrainian territory:\n\nMaintain a strong military defense: Ukraine should focus on building up its military capabilities by investing in modern equipment, more effective training and recruitment efforts and the development of a comprehensive total defense strategy. This allows for more effective counter-attacks as well as maximizing attrition for the invader.\n\nForge and reinforce alliances: Ukraine should work to build alliances with other nations especially if their interests overlap. In light of Russian aggression interested partners might include the European Union, NATO and other parties in the region. These actions will improve security.\n\nMaximize diplomatic efforts: Ukraine should continue to engage in diplomacy to increase pressure on the invader, as well as improving the likelihood of a successful mediation resulting in a complete withdrawal of all Russian forces.\n\nAsymmetric Warfare: Through its reliance on inexpensive Iranian manufactured drones and concentrating on the destruction of civilian infrastructure, extensive propaganda and disinformation campaigns Russia is engaging in asymmetric warfare. This obliges the defender to respond asymmetrically, as Ukraine has done through its Lightning Attacks wherein small mobile units render artillery virtually useless, the use of drones for close surveillance, and putatively the use of special services to neutralize high-priority targets such as command personnel.\n\nIn conclusion, a successful long term deep defense, strong intelligence capabilities, asymmetrical warfare, and powerful allies are the only effective means to counter a numerically superior foe such as the Russian Federation."

    "instruction": "Continuation of chapter one:\n\"2019). Although the parts of the anxiety buffering system are often inter-related, they may still offer slightly other means for terror management. However, when more than one of these anxiety buffers are malfunctioning, people are left defenseless against death-related thoughts and anxiety, which might lead to feelings of helplessness and depression (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012, Mikulincer et al., 2020). Psychopathology might then arise when early childhood problems, traumatic events, or other disruptive life changes increase the level of threat and potential for debilitating anxiety, which requires the normal functioning of the anxiety buffering system. Thus, from the ABDT perspective, low self-esteem, attachment security, and connection to the cultural worldview are a transdiagnostic contributors to mental disorders (Yetzer & Pyszczynski, 2019). Importantly, understanding the pivotal (and yet dynamic) role that self-esteem plays in the anxiety buffering system may allow psychologists to better treat psychological disorders related to anxiety. \n \n \nSelf-Esteem and Immortality \n \nAs we noted in the beginning of this chapter, from the TMT perspective, a central but rather implicit part of self-esteem is the feeling that one is worthy of protection and immortality. Many studies have found that, in line with TMT, believing that one will enjoy modes of literal or symbolic immortality is associated with lower levels of death anxiety and defensiveness in response to reminders of death (e.g., Dechesne et al., 2003; Florian, & Mikulincer, 1998b; Wojtkowiak & Rutjens, 2011). In addition, there are studies showing that MS increases peoples\u2019 motivation for obtaining symbolic immortality (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2010), and that affirming people\u2019s symbolic legacy or literal immortality beliefs reduces DTA and defensiveness in response to MS (e.g., Dechesne et al., 2003; Wojtkowiak & Rutjens, 2011). Thus, immortality beliefs seem to function as death anxiety buffers, as selfesteem does. \nHowever, it is only recently that research has directly assessed whether self-esteem affords people a sense of symbolic immortality. Specifically, Lifshin et al. (2021) conducted several large-scale correlational studies with American college students, in which they included measures of self-esteem (either a short 1-item measure of selfesteem, or the 10-item Rosenberg self-esteem scale), and several measures of symbolic immortality (e.g., \u201cDo you think that you will be remembered by other people after you die [e.g., through your \naccomplishments or legacy]?\u201d; \u201cAfter I die, my impact on the world will continue and be remembered by others\u201d). The researchers also included a measure assessing the participants\u2019 belief that they may enjoy literal immortality (\u201cDo you think that you will live again after you die [e.g., in heaven or through reincarnation?]\u201d), as well as other measures related to terror management and self-esteem such as: in-group identification, loneliness, existential isolation, attachment insecurities, perceived meaning in life, DTA, and depression. \nIn line with the TMT of self-esteem, findings across seven samples indicated that self-esteem was consistently related to believing that one would be remembered and have an impact after they die. Furthermore, this relationship remained strong after statistically controlling for the participants\u2019 levels of loneliness (social connectedness), attachment insecurities, and perceived meaning in life (which were all related to both symbolic immortality and to self-esteem), as well as other variables. This point is important because the findings eliminate these other variables as alternative reasons for why self-esteem predicts belief in one\u2019s symbolic immortality, for example the idea that self-esteem just does so by increasing a sense of social connection. \nFindings from this research also supported the self-esteem and immortality hypothesis regarding literal immortality, although this relationship was weaker than the one between self-esteem and symbolic immortality. Unlike with symbolic immortality, however, self-esteem was only significantly related to a greater sense of literal immortality among participants who believe that an afterlife exists (not among those who do not). \nFinally, the authors conducted mediational analyses showing that participants\u2019 sense of symbolic immortality partially mediated the effect of self-esteem on DTA and depression, as higher levels of self-esteem were associated with higher beliefs in symbolic immortality, which in turn was negatively associated with both DTA and depression. The finding that this mediational effect was only partial suggests that the selfesteem may buffer against death awareness by both providing a more \n\u201cdirect\u201d solution to death (i.e., belief in symbolic immortality) or though raising the degree to which people feel protected more generally. \nThe findings from Lifshin et al. (2021) suggest that feelings of symbolic immortality (or lack thereof) may be an important aspect of self-esteem and the death-anxiety buffering system. However, because these studies were correlational in nature, additional experimental or perhaps longitudinal research is needed to provide stronger support for the notion that higher/lower levels of self-esteem cause higher/lower levels of symbolic immortality. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nIn this chapter we have presented the terror management theory (Greenberg et al. 1986) of self-esteem, which posits that self-esteem functions as a protective psychological resource, shielding people from anxiety in general, as well as from the specific potential for debilitating anxiety resulting from the awareness of mortality. Research reviewed throughout this chapter has supported this terror management function of self-esteem by showing that (1) reminders of death increase self-esteem striving, (2) self-esteem reduces defensiveness, anxiety, and death-related thought in response to reminders of mortality, (3) threats to self-esteem increase death-related cognition, (4) low self-esteem is associated with deficient terror management mechanisms and results in death anxiety and risk for psychopathology after trauma, and (5) high self-esteem is associated with a stronger sense of immortality. \nThe role of self-esteem underlying much of human behavior has been a central theme in psychological theorizing (e.g., Crocker & Wolfe, 2001; Horney, 1937; James, 1890; Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Mead, 1934; Rosenberg, 1965; Sullivan, 1953), and psychological research has borne important findings regarding the importance of self-esteem in psychological functioning (e.g., Orth & Robins, 2014). Illuminating the terror management function of self-esteem has had broad implications for understanding, predicting and modifying human thought and behavior, and research within this framework has advanced psychological research in various domains (for reviews, see Routledge & Vess, 2019; Solomon et al., 2015). We should note that although TMT views self-esteem as driven primarily by defensive needs, it does not argue that these needs are the only ones underlying human behavior or self-esteem, and acknowledges the role of other motivations to acquire self-esteem, such as growth and enrichment motives (e.g., Greenberg et al., 1995). Still, given the evidence reviewed, we believe that terror management theory of self-esteem is critical for understanding what self-esteem is and why it matters. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAbeyta, A.

First , I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl . I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories . I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette . I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle . It is then ready to serve ! Question: Where is the omelette being browned? Option1: In the pan Option2: On the street\nSolution is here: In the pan\nExplanation: As mentioned in the passage that I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan; it is clear that omelette is being browned in pan only.

I sorted into 3 piles - the towels and thick items that do n't have any wash restrictions .

Both options offer a solution to the problem of lugging around heavy bags or having to worry about the security of your possessions. But there are important differences between these two options that you should consider before choosing one.\n\nCoin Lockers\n------------\n\nCoin lockers are usually found at train stations, airports, and tourist hotspots. They are small, self-service storage units that can be rented on an hourly or daily basis. To use a coin locker, you simply place your belongings in the locker, close it, and insert the fee (usually coins or a small amount of cash) into the machine. The locker will then be locked and you will receive a key or a code that you can use to access your belongings later.\n\nBaggage Storage Services\n------------------------\n\nBaggage storage services, on the other hand, are staffed facilities that offer a more comprehensive storage solution for travelers. These services typically allow you to store your bags, suitcases, and other items for a longer period of time, and they often provide additional services such as baggage wrapping and delivery. Unlike coin lockers, baggage storage services are not automated, which means that you will need to interact with a staff member to use the service.\n\nKey Differences\n---------------\n\n* Coin lockers are usually self-service and offer short"

The concept of fate is most certainly tied to Santiago's journey and the purpose it serves, especially in the way it influences his decisions, as he believes following his destiny will lead him to success.\n\nThroughout Santiago's journey, he is faced with a number of decisions and opportunities, which must be navigated with the knowledge that fate will depict the outcome. On his journey, Santiago meets a variety of characters, including the king and the gypsy, and as he listens to their advice, it's clear he is making decisions in faith that fate will pave the way. This is particularly notable in the case of the Alchemist, who directs him in his mission. We are told that Santiago's heart leads him \"only to those things that it had always yearned for\" \u2013 that is, his destiny.\n\nIt is clear from the novel that Santiago's choice to journey in search of his Personal Legend is a path destined for adventure, risk, and more importantly, fulfillment. One of the most remarkable occurrences in the novel is Santiago's journey through the desert, where he relies on fate to protect him from any harm.Here, fate serves as a reminder of Santiago's faith in his ultimate destiny, which leads him to his Personal Legend. \n\nThe idea of fate is a powerful concept in \"The Alchemist\", as Santiago follows his destiny to prove that \"wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure\". In the end, Santiago not only discovers his own treasure, but also finds something much deeper and more meaningful \u2013 the true understanding of his own fate."

In a heated moment over the girl, George punched David in the eye. The injury resulted in a condition called \"anisocoria,\" which caused his pupil to remain permanently dilated, giving the illusion of two different colored eyes. Despite this, George and David remained lifelong friends and Underwood even created some of the artwork for Bowie's early albums.

During 12 days of drought treatment, the plantlets' physiological responses and basic growth traits were measured and analysed. Although drought and FE presence affected plantlet traits to differing degrees, the interactive effects of the two were more pronounced. In particular under mild drought treatment, the FE conferred drought tolerance to plantlets by enhancing leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity; decreasing the degree of plasmalemma oxidation; and increasing the host's abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. When exposed to regular watering or severe drought, these effects were not significant.\n\n### Response:",

    "instruction": "Which of the 10 largest earthquakes was the deadliest?\nLargest Earthquakes ever recorded\nThe 10 largest magnitudes in recorded history\n1. Valdivia, Chile 22 May 1960 (magnitude 9.5)\nThis earthquake killed 1655 people, injured 3000 and displaced two million. It caused US$550 million damage in Chile, while the tsunami that it spawned caused deaths and damage as far away as Hawaii, Japan and the Philippines. The 'rupture zone' of the quake was more than 1000 km long. Two days after the initial quake, the nearby volcano Puyehue erupted, sending ash and steam up to 6 km into the atmosphere over a period of several weeks.\n\n2. Prince William Sound, Alaska 28 March 1964 (magnitude 9.2)\nCompared to the Chilean earthquake, this earthquake was less damaging: the resulting tsunami took 128 lives and caused overall US$311 million in damage. The earthquake was felt mainly over Alaska, as well as some places in Canada, while the tsunami created by it caused damage as far away as Hawaii. The most damage was sustained by the city of Anchorage, 120 km north-west of the epicentre. Shaking from the quake itself is reported to have lasted for three minutes.\n\n3. Sumatra, Indonesia 26 December 2004 (magnitude 9.1)\nIn terms of damage and loss of life, the scale of the disaster caused by the resulting Boxing Day Tsunami was enormous. In total, 227,900 people were killed or presumed dead, with around 1.7 million displaced over 14 countries in South Asia and East Africa. The epicentre was 250 km south-east of Band Aceh, Indonesia, at a depth of 30 km. Several days later on 28 December, a mud volcano began erupting near Baratang, Andamar Islands, which is thought to have been associated with the earthquake.\n\n4. Sendai, Japan 11 March 2011 (magnitude 9.0)\nSo far the official death toll stands at several thousand from the combined effect of the powerful earthquake, aftershocks and the tsunami. However, the total is expected to rise, with some estimates of a final toll of over 10,000. Economic impacts are expected to be huge, with the shutting down of nuclear reactors which many industries rely on for power.\n\n5. Kamchatka, Russia 4 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0)\nThis earthquake generated a tsunami that caused widespread damage in the Hawaiian Islands. Property damage was estimated at around US$1,000,000. Some reports describe waves of over 9 m high at Kaena Point, Oahu. A farmer on Oahu reported the loss of six cows to the tsunami, but no people were reported killed.\n\n6. Bio-bio, Chile 27 February 2010 (magnitude 8.8)\nThis earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed at least 521 people, with 56 missing and 12,000 injured. More than 800,000 people were displaced with a total of 1.8m people affected across Chile, where damage was estimated at US$30 billion. The epicentre was 335 km south-west of Santiago, at a depth of 35 km. A minor tsunami travelled across the Pacific causing damage to boats as far away as San Diego, California.\n\n7. Off the coast of Ecuador 31 January 1906 (magnitude 8.8)\nThis earthquake caused a tsunami that is reported to have killed between 500 and 1,500 in Ecuador and Colombia. The tsunami travelled as far north as San Francisco, on the west coast of the US, and west to Hawaii and Japan. The tsunami took roughly 12 hours to cross the Pacific to Hilo, Hawaii.\n\n8. Rat Islands, Alaska 2 April 1965 (magnitude 8.7)\nThe worst of the damage attributed to this earthquake was caused by a tsunami, reported to be about 10 m high on Shemya Island. The wave caused flooding on Amchitka Island, causing US$10,000 in property damage. No deaths or injuries were reported.\n\n9. Sumatra, Indonesia 28 March 2005 (magnitude 8.6)\nThis earthquake killed 1313, with over 400 people injured by the tsunami as far away as Sri Lanka. The epicentre was 205 km north-west of Sibolga, Sumatra, at a depth of 30 km. This region, also the site of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, is particularly geologically active, with three of the 15 biggest known earthquakes having happened here.\n\n10. Assam - Tibet 15 August 1950 (magnitude 8.6)\nThis inland earthquake caused widespread damages to buildings as well as large landslides. 780 people were killed in eastern Tibet, with many villages and towns affected across Assam, China, Tibet and India. Oscillations to lake levels occurred as far away as Norway. The total death toll is likely to be higher, as no definitive total was ever estimated. While the earthquake itself is known as the Assam Earthquake, it is believed the epicentre may have been in Tibet.",

Context: The classic Key West-style house just off Fleming looked much like the rest of the residences on the block - two-story wooden frame walls and peaked roofs with shallow porches nearly butting up against the sidewalk. Chloe's rusting blue Vespa was tucked away beside the house, in the narrow space separating it from the neighbors. To anyone walking by outside, everything looked quiet and peaceful. Inside, Chloe was pissed. Everything had been going great and then those stupid fuckers had decided to show up a week early, forcing her to scramble to pack a week's work into a single day. She wore a black bandana wrapped around her head, covering her buzz cut pink hair. Numerous smudges of dirt on her cheeks and the tip of her nose testified to the heavy-duty cleaning she'd been doing for the past five hours. She wore loose fitting shorts and a tight-fitting tank top that had once been white. In her bare feet she pushed a mop across the hardwood floors, grumbling to herself. She heard the door open and looked up to see Paul standing in the doorway. Even though it wasn't his fault, she glared at him as he came in. As much as Chloe liked a clean house, she hated housework, and this wasn't even her house. This particular space was sparsely decorated with just a few worn pieces of furniture and some bad condo art on the walls. After six months of being sealed up tight with the air conditioner off, it smelled of dust and mildew and needed a good airing out. \"What are you doing?\" asked Paul, closing the door behind him. \"Mopping,\" she said, her voice flat. \"Right. But why are you mopping here? Whose house is this anyway?\" \"It's one we just added to the roster last week. The cleaning service hasn't had a chance to get in here yet.\" \"I see that,\" said Paul. \"So why're you cleaning it tonight?\" \"We're cleaning it tonight because the Guidarizzi's decided to make a surprise visit to their winter home in Key West. They're coming in tomorrow afternoon. Every other decent place is filled up, so we have to use this one instead.\" Question: Where does Chloe live? Options:  A. Orlando.  B. Miami.  C. Key West.  D. not enough information\nC\n\nRead the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: WASHINGTON \u2014 Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller \u2014 or any prosecutor for that matter \u2014 would ask an interview subject. \"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\" Jaso said.

Options:  A. he thinks he makes the laws  B. not enough information  C. he thinks he is invincible  D. he doesnt watch his actions\nB\n\nRead the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer who is under investigation for his business dealings, has provided legal advice to Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump\u2019s most prominent media supporters. The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a \u201ctaint team\u201d created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a \u201cviable option,\u201d while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a \u201cspecial master\u201d may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed \u201clittle to no legal work\u201d and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen\u2019s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year \u2014 Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third \u201cpublicly prominent individual\u201d who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public. In a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer. \u201cMichael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cI never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\" \u201cI assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,\u201d Hannity said. Fox News also responded to the revelation. \"While Fox News was unaware of Sean Hannity's informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in...

    "instruction": "Some context: Burt Freeman Bacharach ( BAK-@-rak; born May 12, 1928) is an American composer, songwriter, record producer, pianist, and singer who has composed hundreds of popular hit songs from the late 1950s through the 1980s, many in collaboration with popular lyricist Hal David. A six-time Grammy Award winner and three-time Academy Award winner, Bacharach's songs have been recorded by more than 1,000 different artists. As of 2014, he had written 73 US and 52 UK Top 40 hits. He is considered one of the most important composers of 20th-century popular music.\nBacharach's music is characterized by unusual chord progressions, influenced by jazz harmony, with striking syncopated rhythmic patterns, irregular phrasing, frequent modulation, and odd, changing meters. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output. Sometimes called \"easy listening\", he has expressed apprehension regarding that label. According to NJ.com contributor Mark Voger, \"It may be easy on the ears, but it's anything but easy. The precise arrangements, the on-a-dime shifts in meter, and the mouthfuls of lyrics required to service all those notes have, over the years, proven challenging to singers and musicians.\" Bacharach's selection of instruments included flugelhorns, bossa nova sidesticks, breezy flutes, molto fortissimo strings and cooing female voices. According to editors of The Mojo Collection, it led to what became known as the \"Bacharach Sound.\" He explains:  I didn't want to make the songs the same way as they'd been done, so I'd split vocals and instrumentals and try to make it interesting ... For me, it's about the peaks and valleys of where a record can take you. You can tell a story and be able to be explosive one minute then get quiet as kind of a satisfying resolution.  While he didn't mind singing during live performances, he tried to mostly avoid it on records. And when he did sing, he explains, \"I try to sing the songs not as a singer, but just interpreting it as a composer and interpreting a great lyric that Hal [David] wrote.\" When performing in front of live audiences, he would often conduct while playing piano., as he did during a televised performance on The Hollywood Palace, where he played piano and conducted at the same time.\nwhat was his style like?\nA: progressions, influenced by jazz harmony, with striking syncopated rhythmic patterns,\nSome context: Fernando Alvarez de Toledo y Pimentel (29 October 1507 - 11 December 1582), known as the Grand Duke of Alba in Spain and the Iron Duke in the Netherlands, was a Spanish noble, general, and diplomat. He was titled the 3rd Duke of Alba de Tormes, 4th Marquis of Coria, 3rd Count of Salvatierra de Tormes, 2nd Count of Piedrahita, 8th Lord of Valdecorneja, Grandee of Spain, and a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. His motto in Latin was Deo patrum Nostrorum, which in English means \"To the God of our fathers\". He was an adviser of King Charles I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor), and his successor, Philip II of Spain, Mayordomo mayor of both, member of their Councils of State and War, governor of the Duchy of Milan (1555-1556), viceroy of the Kingdom of Naples (1556-1558), governor of the Netherlands (1567-1573) and viceroy and constable of the Kingdom of Portugal (1580-1582).\nFernando was born in Piedrahita, Province of Avila, on 29 October 1507. He was the son of Garcia Alvarez de Toledo y Zuniga, heir of Fadrique Alvarez de Toledo and Enriquez de Quinones, II Duke of Alba de Tormes, and of Beatriz Pimentel, daughter of Rodrigo Alonso Pimentel, IV Count - I Duke of Benavente and his wife, Maria Pacheco. Fernando was orphaned at age three when his father, Garcia, died during a campaign on the island of Djerba in Africa in 1510. At the age of six, Fernando accompanied his grandfather, the second duke of Alba on a military mission to capture Navarre.  His youth and education were typical for Castilian nobility of the age. He was educated at the ducal court of the House of Alba, located in the Castle Palace of Alba de Tormes, by two Italian preceptors, Bernardo Gentile - a Sicilian Benedictine - and Severo Marini and by the Spanish Renaissance poet and writer Juan Boscan. He was educated in Roman Catholicism and humanism. He mastered Latin and knew French, English and German.  In 1524, when he was seventeen, he joined the troops of Constable of Castile, Inigo Fernandez de Velasco, II Duke of Frias, during the capture of Fuenterrabia, then occupied by France and Navarre. For his role in the siege, Fernando was appointed governor of Fuenterrabia.  When his grandfather Fadrique died in 1531, the ducal title passed to Fernando as the firstborn son of Garcia. Throughout his adulthood, he served the Spanish monarchs Charles I and his successor Philip II.\nWhat did he accomplish as a troop?\nA: For his role in the siege, Fernando was appointed governor of Fuenterrabia.\nSome context: Rascal Flatts is an American country band formed in Columbus, Ohio in 1999. It is composed of Gary LeVox, his second cousin Jay DeMarcus and Joe Don Rooney. DeMarcus is also a brother-in-law of country music singer James Otto, and formerly one-half of the Christian music duo East to West. They are best known for performing a cover of Tom Cochrane's \"Life Is a Highway\".\nRascal Flatts' founding was at Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar in Nashville, Tennessee. Gary LeVox and Jay DeMarcus are second cousins from a musical family. DeMarcus moved to Nashville in 1992, earning his first record deal as part of a Christian group called East to West; his brother-in-law, James Otto, is also a country music singer. In 1997, DeMarcus called LeVox, and convinced him to come to Nashville and provide some harmonies on Michael English's album Gospel, which he was producing. They engineered the album together, and became English's back-up band.  At the same time, DeMarcus had become the bandleader of Chely Wright's band, where he met Joe Don Rooney, the guitarist in that band. DeMarcus and LeVox were working in a Printer's Alley nightclub and when their part-time guitarist could not make it one night, DeMarcus invited Rooney to join them. Jim Riley was the drummer and bandleader for the band. The group covered the hit Shenandoah single The Church on Cumberland Road that night. To the group's recollection, a bond was formed instantly.  Singer Mila Mason recommended the group to record producers Mark Bright and Marty Williams, who played Lyric Street Records A&R Doug Howard a three-song demo and Howard thought they were \"just incredible.\" After he'd heard the demos, the band went into the Lyric Street offices the next day, sat down with acoustic guitars, and played a couple of songs. According to Howard in an interview with HitQuarters: \"The vocals and harmonies, it was all there--I was just blown away. The lead singer has such a unique and compelling voice.\" The band was signed to Lyric Street in late 1999.\nWhat was their first song\nA:",

Sign up for newsletters to receive updates and special offers from hotels, airlines and rental cars. Also, take advantage of rewards programs like frequent flyer miles and loyalty cards. \n\nThird, travel off-season. Visiting your desired location during the off-season can result in significantly lower rates. Not to mention, it\u2019s usually less crowded, so you\u2019ll get to experience the location from a more intimate perspective. \n\nFourth, consider alternative options for accommodations. Renting a house, using Airbnb or Couchsurfing can often save you money, compared to staying in a hotel. \n\nFinally, forget about splurging. Eating out every night and activities add up quickly.

    "output": "Cave painting, also known as parietal art, is an ancient practice of creating artwork on cave walls and ceilings. The exact origin of cave painting is difficult to determine due to lack of historical records from such a long time ago, but it is believed to have begun during the Upper Paleolithic period, around 40,000 years ago.\n\nThere are several theories about why ancient humans began painting on cave walls. Some scientists believe that cave painting emerged as a form of early communication or storytelling, as a way for early humans to share their experiences and knowledge with one another. Others believe that it may have had a spiritual or religious purpose, as many of the paintings depict animals and hunting scenes that could have been associated with rituals or believed to have brought good luck to hunters.\n\nIn any case, cave painting required the development of basic artistic skills and the preparation of pigments and tools, suggesting that early humans were highly creative and capable of abstract thinking. Whatever the reason, cave painting has left us with a valuable record of human history and artistic expression that continues to fascinate people to this day."

    "instruction": "6. Discussion \n\nTwo factors affect the accessibility to touristic sites by public means: the location of accommodations (mainly hotels and hostels) and the alignment of the public transport system. In Jerusalem most of the hotels catering to individual tourists can be found in proximity to the old city or along the first route of the LRT [18]. Hotels further afield largely cater to groups [20], which are not part of this study. Hence, the main factors affecting the accessibility of the various sites are their location and proximity to the public transport routes, and particularly the LRT. From a policy perspective this implies that the main factor affecting the LOS of the public transport for tourist is the alignment of the public transport system, and particularly the main highly visible lines of the LRT and to a lesser extent the HGB. The question is thus to what extent the demand of tourists affects the alignment of these lines.The two most accessible sites identified in Figure 3 and Figure 4 Mahne Yehuda market and Jaffa Gate/Mamilla are widely frequented by Jerusalem\u2019s residents. The same is true, to a lesser extent of Mount Herzel, as the LRT station at its entrance, which is the current terminus of the LRT, is one of the major points of transfer for Jerusalemites coming from the southwestern part of the city. With the exception of the Garden Tomb, which happens to be located close the LRT and the Palestinian CBD and the Chagall Windows which are within the Ein Karem Hadassah Hospital, all other sites are not major nodes in the daily activity patterns of Jerusalemites, and hence the LOS to these sites tends to be lower. The role of tourist sites in planning Jerusalem\u2019s public transport systems can be garnered also by looking at the current planned expansions of the LRT system. These include at present extensions of the existing line to Neve Yaacov neighborhood in the north, to the Ein Karem Hadassah hospital in the south west and to the two campuses of the Hebrew University (on Givaat Ram and Mount Scopus). The next two lines are planned from the southern part of the city to the northern part of the city, passing through the center, thereby largely by-passing the old city region. From a tourism perspective they will greatly improve the accessibility of the Chagall windows which are within the Ein Karem Hadassah hospital, and perhaps somewhat improve the accessibility to the Israel Museum. With these two exceptions none of these extensions will improve the accessibility of the main under-served sites analyzed herein. Moreover, also in the case of the Chagall windows and the Israel Museum the extensions of the existing line is not geared toward them, and the improved accessibility to these sites can be considered a positive externality of improvements geared to other nodes (the hospital and the university). Seemingly, the Palestinian and Ultra-Orthodox services can provide a partial response to the lacunas in the LRT and Egged bus services. Yet, these services are largely invisible to tourists. They are very hard to find on the web in English, and do not appear on the municipal English-language sites. While the Kavey Mehadrin may well try to avoid serving tourists, as they seek to maintain the unofficial and illegal gender-separation, the Palestinian service can well serve tourists, as it does serve some of the least accessible sites such as Mount of Olives. Thus, the segmentation of the public transport services has particularly adverse effects for tourists, as the lack of coordination between these systems prevents tourists from utilizing the relative advantages of the different systems. The picture that emerges from our analysis, as well as from the analysis of the proposed extension of the LRT system, is that public transport lines are demarcated as a function of the demand by residents. Tourists are hardly taken into account, if at all. As a result some ad-hoc services are provided by sites interested in attracting visitors. Most notably, Yad Vashem operates a shuttle service from the Mount Herzl terminus and a new shuttle has started to operate from the old train station (called first Station) to the Western Wall. While there is a single hop-on hop-off line (no. 99), its service is very infrequent, and it fails to provide an effective tourist-oriented service. Hence, the lack of tourist-oriented services, pointed out more than a decade ago by Israeli and Mansfeld [13], has not been improved in the interim, and major sites, which constitute the world image of Jerusalem, continue to be under-served. 7. Conclusions Tourist flows do not conform to the travel patterns of Jerusalemites, both spatially and temporally. Being segmented as it is, the different segments of the Jerusalem population are served by three different bus services, as well as by the LRT. Yet, none of these provides the services that would make all the historic and religious sites with which Jerusalem\u2019s worldwide fame rests accessible to tourists. Rather, the public transport system, both existing and planned, is geared toward the needs of the three population groups that jointly are called Jerusalemites, thereby disregarding the fourth travel segment\u2014the tourists. There are two possible explanations to the oversight of the tourist travel segment in Jerusalem. The first is a professional oversight. Since transport planning tends to focus on peak hour travel during working days, public transport is geared toward such travel. The travel demand to tourist destinations during these peak hours is low, and hence they are not accounted for in the public transport plans. For this reason only tourist destinations that are in proximity to sites to which there is high demand in peak hours are well served. The second explanation is political. Public transport provision has a political dimension. This is perhaps more poignant in Jerusalem then elsewhere (Shlay & Rosen, 2015). The lack of services to tourist destinations from this perspective can be attributed to the lack of interest in serving Christian pilgrims or as the lack of power of tourism interests in the city. As the results of this study show that marginalized sites cannot be differentiated by religiosity or denomination the first option is rejected. The second option requires further study. But it can be hypothesized that the heavy reliance on groups (whether pilgrims or not) and on high-end tourism, and the fragmented nature of the tourism industry in Jerusalem, result in the relative disinterest of tourism interests in the public transport field, and hence in the absence of a voice for the individual international tourist in the forums where public transport decisions are made. While a full analysis of both explanations is beyond the scope of this paper, it seems that both of them combined to explain the oversight of the tourist sector in the provision of public transport services in Jerusalem. Still, several improvements in the LOS provided to independent tourists can be derived from this study. The most obvious is to make better utilization of the Palestinian bus system, which provides services to some of the under-served sites in east Jerusalem, such as Mount of Olives and Gethsemane. To this end the routes and schedules have to be displayed in English, and an English-language website that includes all these services should be set. A second, complementary, step is to provide integrated ticketing to all bus companies and the LRT available to tourists for various lengths of stay. A third, costlier option is to provide tour-ist-oriented specialized services such as frequent hop-on hop-off services, particularly in peak tourist season. Such a service, suggested long ago by Israeli and Mansfeld (2003), may be difficult to sustain due to the variances in tourist flows, and the political tensions in the city. A somewhat cheaper alternative may be shuttle services to the main LRT stations, such as operated by Yad Vashem. A prerequisite to the planning of such services should be a survey of independent tourists regarding their travel patterns and needs. At present such tourists often have to do with other alternatives (such as taxis, or one-day tours), that are often more expensive than the PT. But the utilization of these options may be due to the lack of better PT services, and hence a demand analysis is warranted. As none of the PT improvement provisions suggested above is likely to be advanced by the transportation authorities, due to their focus on \u201cregular\u201d services to Jerusalemites, there will be a need to find someone who will seek to improve the services to tourists. Such a \u201cchampion\u201d can be the Ministry or national company for tourism, the municipality, or a body created for this purpose at the behest of local tourism interests by either the ministry of the municipality. Thus, it seems that the main obstacle to the advancement of tourist-responsive public transport services in Jerusalem is the lack of an institutional actor who will make this a priority. While this paper focuses on Jerusalem, the general question of how should tourists be served when the main tourist sites are not in proximity to the main nodes used daily by the local population requires attention. To this end the methodology used here, whereby CED was differentiated from the Euclidian distances by using LCM, and the origins and destinations were specified for the international individual tourists, can be used elsewhere. Clearly, such analyses can then be utilized to plan for tourist-oriented public transport systems (such as extensive hop-on hop-off buses). The question is whether the municipal authorities have the incentive to do so. In the highly segmented and highly contested Jerusalem scene tourist interests do not receive wide attention, and do not have sufficient political clout. In places where tourism has a greater role, or tourism-related interests have greater economic and political clout such services can be expected to be provided. However, an examination of this hypothesis remains for future studies.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "In conclusion, the study finds that the public transportation system in Jerusalem does not offer good accessibility to many of the tourist destinations in the city. The main factor affecting the accessibility is the location of the sites and their proximity to the public transport routes, particularly the Light Rail Transit (LRT) system. From a policy perspective, this implies that the main factor affecting the level of service (LOS) of the public transport for tourists is the alignment of the public transport system, and particularly the main, highly visible lines of the LRT. The study also finds that the segmentation of the public transport services has particularly adverse effects for tourists, as the lack of coordination between these systems prevents tourists from utilizing the relative advantages of the different systems. Overall, the study highlights the need for a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to planning public transportation in Jerusalem that takes into account the needs of tourists, as well as residents."

One popular method for this task is the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide using Python and the scikit-learn library:\n\n1. Install scikit-learn if you haven't already:\n```bash\npip install scikit-learn\n```\n1. Import the necessary libraries:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN\n```\n1. Create an array of mouse coordinates (replace this with your actual data):\n```python\nmouse_coordinates = np.array([\n    [x1, y1],\n    [x2, y2],\n    # ... more coordinates\n])\n```\n1. Choose appropriate values for the DBSCAN parameters:\n* `eps` (epsilon): The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered as in the same neighborhood.\n* `min_samples`: The minimum number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point.\n```python\neps = 50  # Adjust this value based on your data and screen resolution\nmin_samples = 5  # Adjust this value based on your desired cluster density\n```\n1. Apply DBSCAN:\n```python\ndbscan = DBSCAN(eps=eps, min_samples=min_samples)\ndbscan.fit(mouse_coordinates)\n```\n1. The `dbscan.labels_` attribute will contain the cluster labels for each coordinate:\n```python\ncluster_labels = dbscan.labels_\n```\n1. To get the interesting parts of the screen that the user hovered over, you can calculate the centroids of the clusters. First, filter out the noise points (label = -1), and then calculate the centroids:\n```python\nclusters = {}\nfor idx, label in enumerate(cluster_labels):\n    if label != -1:\n        if label not in clusters:\n            clusters[label] = []\n        clusters[label].append(mouse_coordinates[idx])\n\n# Calculate the centroids of the clusters\ncentroids = {}\nfor label, points in clusters.items():\n    points_arr = np.array(points)\n    centroids[label] = np.mean(points_arr, axis=0)\n\nprint(centroids)\n```\nThe `centroids` dictionary will contain the coordinates of the centroids of the interesting regions on the screen. You can adjust the `eps` and `min_samples` parameters to fine-tune the clustering results based on your specific use case."

Jack cautiously pushed open the door and found himself face to face with a mysterious, hooded figure.\n\nThe figure revealed himself to be a wizard who had been trapped in the castle for years. The wizard had been searching for a brave adventurer like Jack to help him escape. The wizard explained that an evil sorcerer had cursed him and trapped him in the castle. He promised to reward Jack with a great treasure if he could break the curse and help him escape.\n\nJack was excited at the prospect of such an adventure and agreed to help the wizard. Together, they journeyed through the castle, dodging traps and battling fierce monsters. They solved riddles and puzzles and discovered secret passages that led them closer to breaking the curse.\n\nAs they drew closer to the end of their quest, Jack began to realize that the treasure he was seeking was not just the reward promised by the wizard, but the journey itself. He had discovered new strengths and skills within himself, and he had made a true friend in the wizard.\n\nFinally, after many trials and tribulations, Jack and the wizard broke the curse and escaped the castle. They emerged into the sunlight, blinking in the brightness of the outside world. The wizard kept his promise and gave Jack a chest full of gold and jewels, but Jack knew that the real treasure was the adventure they had shared.\n\nFrom that day forward, Jack continued to explore the world, seeking out new adventures and making new friends. He knew that life was full of treasure, but it was up to him to find it. And so, he journeyed on, with a heart full of courage and a spirit of adventure."

Auguste marries Rodmilla de Ghent, a haughty baroness with two daughters, Marguerite and Jacqueline. Auguste gives Danielle a copy of Sir Thomas More's Utopia. Later, when leaving for a trip, Auguste dies of a heart attack. By the time Danielle is eighteen, the estate has fallen into decline and Danielle is forced to be a servant to Rodmilla and her daughters. Jacqueline is the only one out of her family to show Danielle any kindness. One day, Danielle stops a man from stealing her father's horse and in the process realizes he is Prince Henry. He buys her silence with gold, as he is fleeing an arranged marriage to the Spanish Princess Gabriella. He is caught, however, after he recovers and returns the Mona Lisa to Leonardo da Vinci, which had been stolen by gypsies. Meanwhile, Danielle uses the gold Henry gave her to buy back the servant Maurice, who Rodmilla sold into slavery to pay off her debts. To do this, she dresses as a noblewoman and is warned that she will be severely punished if discovered. Henry overhears Danielle arguing with the Cargomaster and orders Maurice's release. Henry insistently begs for Danielle's name until she finally gives him the name of her deceased mother, Nicole de Lancret, with the added title of comtesse (countess). King Francis tells Henry that he is throwing a masquerade ball, where he must choose a bride or wed Gabriella.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.\n\nA: Johnston\nQ: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the  full name of the New York Dolls guitarist? , can you please find it?   With Morton, the New York Dolls recorded Too Much Too Soon in 1974 at A&R Studios in New York City. The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \"looser\" feel he provided for their music. \"That man is completely unpretentious\", Johansen said of the producer. \"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together. To complete the album, they had to record cover songs and re-record some of the band's earlier demos; \"Babylon\", \"Who Are the Mystery Girls?\", \"It's Too Late\" and \"Human Being\" had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, \"Teenage News\" and \"Too Much Too Soon\", before working with Morton, but neither was considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling he had been in a rush: \"He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts.\"According to journalist Tony Fletcher, Morton would have been more productive on Too Much Too Soon had it not been for his alcoholism and the lifestyles of the band members\u2014bassist Arthur Kane was also an alcoholic, while Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan had heroin addictions.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage.\nContext: Although soil scientists recognize thousands of types of soil - each with its own specific characteristics and name - lets consider just three soil types. This will help you to understand some of the basic ideas about how climate produces a certain type of soil, but there are many exceptions to what we will learn right now (Figure 1.1). Just some of the thousands of soil types. Deciduous trees, the trees that lose their leaves each winter, need at least 65 cm of rain per year. These forests produce soils called pedalfers, which are common in many areas of the temperate, eastern part of the United States (Figure 1.2). The word pedalfer comes from some of the elements that are commonly found in the soil. The \"Al\" in pedalfer is the chemical symbol of the element aluminum, and the \"Fe\" in pedalfer is the chemical symbol for iron. Pedalfers are usually a very fertile, dark brown or black soil. Not surprisingly, they are rich in aluminum clays and iron oxides. Because a great deal of rainfall is common in this climate, most of the soluble minerals dissolve and are carried away, leaving the less soluble clays and iron oxides behind. A pedalfer is the dark, fertile type of soil that will form in a forested region. Pedocal soils form in drier, temperate areas where grasslands and brush are the usual types of vegetation (Figure chemical weathering and less water to dissolve away soluble minerals, so more soluble minerals are present and fewer clay minerals are produced. It is a drier region with less vegetation, so the soils have lower amounts of organic material and are less fertile. A pedocal is named for the calcite enriched layer that forms. Water begins to move down through the soil layers, but before it gets very far, it begins to evaporate. Soluble minerals, like calcium carbonate, concentrate in a layer that marks the lowest place that water was able to reach. This layer is called caliche. A lizard on soil typical of an arid region in Mexico. In tropical rainforests where it rains literally every day, laterite soils form (Figure 1.4). In these hot, wet, tropical regions, intense chemical weathering strips the soils of their nutrients. There is practically no humus. All soluble minerals are removed from the soil and all plant nutrients are carried away. All that is left behind are the least soluble materials, like aluminum and iron oxides. These soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. Laterite soils bake as hard as a brick if they are exposed to the Sun. A laterite is the type of thick, nutrient-poor soil that forms in the rainforest. Many climate types have not been mentioned here. Each produces a distinctive soil type that forms in the particular circumstances found there. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner but soluble minerals may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick but nutrient-poor. Soil development takes a very long time, it may take hundreds or even thousands of years for a good fertile topsoil to form. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil-forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions, soil formation may take thousands of years! \n Question: which of the soils bake as hard as a brick if exposed to the sun.",

Adem\u00e1s invent\u00f3 instrumentos que procedimientos que hasta la fecha son usados, por ejemplo, cre\u00f3 el primer c\u00e1mara de destilaci\u00f3n a la cual llam\u00f3 tribikos, un extractor para recoger vapores y el tradicional \u201cba\u00f1o Mar\u00eda\u201d que todos usamos en la cocina y que se sigue usando en los laboratorios para m\u00faltiples funciones.\n\nLise Meitner (Austria, 1878-1968): fue una cient\u00edfica austriaca que contribuy\u00f3 a los descubrimientos del elemento protactinio y la fisi\u00f3n nuclear. Mientras trabajaba en el Instituto Kaiser Wilhelm sobre radiactividad, descubri\u00f3 el is\u00f3topo radiactivo protactinio-231 en 1917. Form\u00f3 parte del equipo que descubri\u00f3 la fisi\u00f3n nuclear, en el a\u00f1o 1938, junto a su sobrino y el f\u00edsico Otto Hahn, amigo y colaborador suyo. Por este logro, Otto Hahn recibi\u00f3 el Premio Nobel.2\u200b Albert Einstein la elogi\u00f3 como la \"Marie Curie alemana\".\n\nEmmy Noether (Alemania, 1882-1935): Einstein la consideraba la mujer m\u00e1s importante en la historia de las matem\u00e1ticas. A pesar de que en su \u00e9poca (finales del siglo XIX y principios del XX) las mujeres no pod\u00edan acceder a la universidad, Noether rompi\u00f3 todas las barreras cient\u00edficas y sociales y revolucion\u00f3 con su forma de hacer matem\u00e1ticas. Fue art\u00edfice el \u00e1lgebra moderna y el teorema de Noether, que permit\u00eda entender y resolver el problema de la conservaci\u00f3n de la energ\u00eda, clave para la visi\u00f3n actual del Universo y para comprender la Teor\u00eda de la Relatividad de Albert Einstein. Fue expulsada de Alemania por los nazis al ser jud\u00eda y pacifista, lo que le oblig\u00f3 a emigrar a Estados Unidos. Se convirti\u00f3 en un hito al convertirse en la primera mujer plenaria en un Congreso Internacional de Matem\u00e1ticos, en 1932, y en ser la primera tambi\u00e9n en estar habilitada para dar clases en la Universidad de Erlanger-Nuremberg (Baviera, Alemania).\n\nRita Levi-Montalcini(Italia, 1909-2012): fue una neur\u00f3loga y senadora italiana que, trabajando con veneno de serpiente, tumores y saliva de rat\u00f3n, descubri\u00f3 el factor de crecimiento nervioso (NGF, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s), una prote\u00edna que regula el crecimiento del nervio y mantiene sanas las neuronas. Los factores de crecimiento neuronal \u2013neurotrofinas\u2013 son prote\u00ednas que contribuyen al sustento de las neuronas, gu\u00edan a sus axones hacia las conexiones adecuadas para formar circuitos neuronales sanos y evitan la muerte celular.\n\nDorothy Crowfoot (Egipto, 1910\u20131994): Premiada por la Academia Sueca en 1964, Dorothy fue una qu\u00edmica brit\u00e1nica que desarroll\u00f3 la t\u00e9cnica de difracci\u00f3n de rayos X para aplicarla en la estructura tridimensional de las mol\u00e9culas org\u00e1nicas complejas. Adem\u00e1s, despleg\u00f3 la cristalograf\u00eda de prote\u00ednas, raz\u00f3n por la que fue ganadora del Premio Nobel el 1964 (la tercera mujer en recibirlo despu\u00e9s de Marie Curie y su hija Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie). En 1969 hall\u00f3 la estructura cristalina de la insulina, medicamento necesario para el tratamiento de pacientes con diabetes mellitus. Posteriormente consigui\u00f3 investigar el calciferol y la vitamina D2. Se convirti\u00f3 en profesora investigadora de la Royal Society en 1960.  \n\nAda Yonath (Israel, 1939-act): es una cient\u00edfica israel\u00ed que ha recibido gran reconocimiento a nivel internacional; es la primera mujer israel\u00ed en ganar un premio Nobel. El reconocimiento lo adquiri\u00f3 por sus descubrimientos en el \u00e1rea de la bioqu\u00edmica. Invent\u00f3 una t\u00e9cnica de cristalograf\u00eda para visualizar estructuras bioqu\u00edmicas, con ella descubri\u00f3 algunos de los mecanismos m\u00e1s importantes del cuerpo en la producci\u00f3n de prote\u00ednas. Por ejemplo, ayud\u00f3 a entender el funcionamiento y los mecanismos del ribosoma, la estructura encargada de producir prote\u00ednas a partir del c\u00f3digo gen\u00e9tico."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Si no puedes resolver una ecuaci\u00f3n diferencial de forma anal\u00edtica, puedes recurrir a m\u00e9todos num\u00e9ricos. Estos m\u00e9todos proporcionan soluciones aproximadas, pero pueden ser bastante precisas si se emplean adecuadamente. Algunos de los m\u00e9todos num\u00e9ricos m\u00e1s comunes son:\n\n1. **M\u00e9todo de Euler:** Este es el m\u00e9todo m\u00e1s simple y consiste en aproximar la soluci\u00f3n mediante l\u00edneas tangentes locales. Se parte de un valor inicial y se avanza en \"pasos\" (\u0394t) para calcular los siguientes puntos de la soluci\u00f3n.\n\n2. **M\u00e9todos de Runge-Kutta:** Estos m\u00e9todos mejoran la aproximaci\u00f3n al considerar m\u00faltiples pendientes en cada paso. El m\u00e9todo Runge-Kutta de cuarto orden (RK4) es ampliamente utilizado debido a su precisi\u00f3n y estabilidad.\n\n3. **M\u00e9todos de predicci\u00f3n-correcci\u00f3n:** Estos m\u00e9todos utilizan un predictor para estimar la soluci\u00f3n en el siguiente paso y un corrector para ajustar la soluci\u00f3n bas\u00e1ndose en la estimaci\u00f3n previa. Un ejemplo popular es el m\u00e9todo de Adams-Bashforth-Moulton.\n\n4. **M\u00e9todo de elementos finitos:** Este m\u00e9todo es particularmente \u00fatil para resolver ecuaciones diferenciales parciales en geometr\u00edas complejas. El dominio se divide en peque\u00f1os elementos y se resuelve el problema en cada elemento de forma aproximada.\n\n5. **M\u00e9todo de diferencias finitas:** Este m\u00e9todo transforma la ecuaci\u00f3n diferencial en un sistema de ecuaciones algebraicas al aproximar las derivadas mediante diferencias finitas.\n\nPara resolver ecuaciones diferenciales num\u00e9ricamente, a menudo se utilizan paquetes de software especializados. Algunos ejemplos de bibliotecas y programas que pueden ser \u00fatiles son:\n\n- En Python: SciPy, NumPy y SymPy.\n- En MATLAB: La funci\u00f3n `ode45`, que implementa el m\u00e9todo RK4 adaptativo.\n- En Mathematica: La funci\u00f3n `NDSolve`.\n\nRecuerda que los m\u00e9todos num\u00e9ricos son aproximaciones y pueden estar sujetos a errores de redondeo, truncamiento y estabilidad. Aseg\u00farate de elegir el m\u00e9todo m\u00e1s adecuado para tu problema y de controlar la precisi\u00f3n y convergencia de la soluci\u00f3n."

    "instruction": "Please outline and script a feature section of a regular water industry specialist broadcast in which the presenters trial 2 different water and energy efficient shower heads, from a company named Gjosa and a company named Altered. The idea is to assess various elements of each product, e.g. cost, ease of installation, feel, actual measured water efficiency performance etc, and reach a conclusion about which to recommend. Though note that the main goal is to promote water and energy efficiency in the broad sense rather than a specific consumer product, so it would not be a bad thing if the conclusion is that either one is a good idea. The feature will be in a lighthearted documentary style, with video clips from the presenters' houses (a shower head will be installed at each of the 2 presenters' houses). It will last 3 minutes.",

    "output": "Introduction:\n\nHello and welcome to our latest feature on water and energy efficiency in the home. Today, we'll be putting two shower heads to the test, the Gjosa and the Altered, both of which promise to save you water and energy while still providing a great shower experience. We've installed one of each in the homes of our two presenters, Sarah and Dave, and over the next three minutes we'll be giving you an in-depth look at each product and sharing our thoughts on which one comes out on top.\n\nSegment 1: Gjosa\n\nFirst up, we have the Gjosa shower head. Sarah, who has been using the Gjosa for the past week, has this to say:\n\n(Sarah video clip) \"I have to say, I was a bit skeptical at first. I wasn't sure if a more efficient shower head would be as good as my old one. But I have to say, the Gjosa has really impressed me. It was really easy to install, it only took a few minutes and I didn't need any special tools. And the best part is, it feels just like my old shower head. I haven't noticed any difference in water pressure or temperature. It's just as good as my old one, but with the added bonus of knowing I'm using less water and energy.\"\n\nSegment 2: Altered\n\nNext up, we have the Altered shower head. Dave, who has been using the Altered for the past week, has this to say:\n\n(Dave video clip) \"I have to say, I was a bit nervous about trying out a new shower head. I'm pretty particular about my shower experience and I wasn't sure if the Altered would measure up. But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. It was super easy to install, just like the Gjosa. And the water pressure and temperature have been spot on. I haven't noticed any difference in my shower experience at all, but the added bonus is that I'm using less water and energy. It's a win-win.\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nSo there you have it, both the Gjosa and the Altered shower heads have received rave reviews from our presenters. But which one comes out on top? Well, it's really a tie. Both shower heads were easy to install, provided a great shower experience, and saved water and energy. So whether you go with the Gjosa or the Altered, you really can't go wrong. The important thing is that you're making a conscious effort to save water and energy in your home, and both of these products make it easy to do just that."

    "output": "The purpose of usability testing is to evaluate a product, system or website by testing it with users from the target audience. During the testing, participants attempt to complete tasks while observers watch, listen and take notes. The primary goal is to identify any usability issues and areas for improvement, to ensure the product is easy to use, effective, efficient, and user-friendly. Through usability testing, designers and developers can gain valuable insight into users' interactions with their product, allowing them to make design decisions based on evidence, rather than assumptions. Ultimately, this process results in a better product that meets the needs and expectations of its users."

Sometimes,people also don't say exactly what they mean.For example,when someone asks \"Do you agree?\".the other person might  be thinking,\"No,I disagree.I think you're wrong.\"But it isn't very  polite to disagree so strongly,so the other person might say \"I'm not  so sure.\"It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people.For example,many talks over the phone finish when one person says \"I have to go now.\"Often,the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse:\"Someone's at the  door.\"\"Something is burning on the stove.\"The excuse might be real,or it might not.Perhaps the person who wants to hang up simply  doesn't want to talk any more,but it isn't polite to say that.The excuse is more polite,and it doesn't hurt the other person. Whether they are greeting each other,talking about an idea,or finishing a talk,people often don't say exactly what they are thinking.  It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other,and it's part of the game of language. Question: When a person says \"I have to go now.Someone's at the  door.\",the person may be  _  .

He was created by Stan Lee in 1963 and was first introduced to the world in the pages of Marvel Comic Books. Spiderman's story is the story of Peter Parker, a child who lost his parents and lives with his aunt and uncle. Peter is a shy, quiet boy wearing glasses and has few friends. One day, on a high school class trip to a science lab, he gets bitten by a special spider. Soon Peter realizes he has amazing powers: he is as strong and quick as a spider and also has a type of sixth sense. He no longer needs his glasses and he can use his super power to fly through the city streets! Remembering something his Uncle Ben has told him _ ,Peter decides to use his powers to fight against enemies who do cruel things to people. And so, Spiderman is born. Life is not easy for Peter even though he is a superhero. He is in love with Mary Jane but he can't tell her about his amazing powers. Besides, his best friend Harry hates Spiderman! Peter is also short of money and time. He has to sell photos of Spiderman (himself!) to a newspaper and he keeps losing his other jobs because he's so busy saving people! Yet he has to fight against different kinds of cruel enemies. Question: What happened to Peter Parker after he was bitten by the spider? Yes or no, is the answer \"He developed spider- like powers.\"?\nNo\n------\nArticle: In most parts of the world there are four seasons. They are spring, summer, fall and winter. In different seasons people wear different clothes and do different things. For example, in summer the weather is hot, so people usually wear cool clothes and do things like swimming, boating or surfing . But near the polar regions , there are only two seasons: winter and summer. In winter, nights are long. For more than two months  you can't see the sun. In summer, days are long and the sun is always in the sky. There are no nights. The people living near the North Pole  are called Inuit . In summer they live in tents and catch deer for food. In winter they live in small round snow houses. They can build  a snow house. They make holes  in the ice and catch fish and seals . They eat much meat but not many vegetables.

The way Charles Grant wrote these 'beings' was clever, because you never really know if they're human or not, even at the end of the book. You have to decide.There are spooky moments and the book was written nice and smooth. The only thing I would have liked was for a little more written on the Jackals' night prowlings. The main story line is defense against them and not more sprawled out, giving you a chance to see behind the scenes of one of their prowls. Other than that, this was a solid, four star book that any fan of classic horror should read. No splatter-gore, but still spook and a decent story.\nThe answer is:",

    "instruction": "What is structural genomics?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.\n\nBecause protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.\n\nAs opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.\n\nStructural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated centers of structural genomics.\n\nWhile most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A Science article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.\n\nOne advantage of structural genomics, such as the Protein Structure Initiative, is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely Open protein structure annotation network (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers."

It's hard to follow up an album like AEnima. SO naturally i was very dissapointed in Lateralus. I had some high hopes for 10,000 days but no good. I like Lateralus better.. All the senseless filler they do now, every song has to be 10 minutes long and they have to throw in as many parts and tempos and time signatures into one song as they can.. The result is just a bland blend of prog rock. I haven't been able to stand Maynard since Perfect Circle, the music is just too much.. Hooker With a P+nis off of Aenima was great. Heavey hook, solid length and a great song. Now, they are just trying to pull off the AEnima production with lower quality hooks and songs...

He overhears the conversations of passers-by regarding the origins of the wealth of the mansion's owner, Monsieur de Lanty. There is also the presence of an unknown old man around the house, whom the family was oddly devoted to, and who frightened and intrigued the partygoers. When the man sits next to the narrator s guest, Beatrix Rochefide, she touches him, and the narrator rushes her out of the room. The narrator says he knows who the man is and says he will tell her his story the next evening.\nThe next evening, the narrator tells Mme de Rochefide about Ernest-Jean Sarrasine, a passionate, artistic boy, who after having trouble in school became a prodigy of the sculptor Bouchardon. Sarrasine becomes a talented young man and, after one of his sculptures wins a competition, he heads to Rome where he sees a theatre performance featuring Zambinella. He falls in love with her, going to all of her performances and creating a clay mold of her. After spending time with her at a party, Sarrasine attempts to seduce Zambinella. She is reticent, suggesting some hidden secret or danger to their alliance. Sarrasine becomes increasingly convinced that Zambinella is the ideal woman. Sarrasine develops a plan to abduct her from a party at the French embassy. When Sarrasine arrives, Zambinella is dressed as a man. Sarrasine speaks to a cardinal, who is Zambinella s patron, and is told that Zambinella is a castrato. Sarrasine refuses to believe the cardinal and leaves the party, seizing Zambinella. Once they are at his studio, Zambinella confirms that she is a castrato. Sarrasine is about to kill Zambinella as a group of the cardinal s men barge in and stab Sarrasine. The narrator then reveals that the old man around the household is Zambinella, Marianina's maternal great uncle. The story ends with Mme de Rochefide's expressing her distress about the story she has just been told.\n\nOutput:",

    "instruction": "Input: Beer\nThe earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa 3500\u20133100 BC from the site of Godin Tepe in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer; examples include a prayer to the goddess Ninkasi, known as \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people, and the ancient advice (Fill your belly. Day and night make merry) to Gilgamesh, recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh, by the ale-wife Siduri may, at least in part, have referred to the consumption of beer. The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC. A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike sake, mould was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting.\n\nIn what country was the earliest chemical evidence of barley beer found?\nOutput: Iran\n\nInput: Pacific War\nBy 1937, Japan controlled Manchuria and was ready to move deeper into China. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident on 7 July 1937 provoked full-scale war between China and Japan. The Nationalist and Communist Chinese suspended their civil war to form a nominal alliance against Japan, and the Soviet Union quickly lent support by providing large amount of materiel to Chinese troops. In August 1937, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to fight about 300,000 Japanese troops in Shanghai, but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937 and committed which was known as Nanking Massacre. In March 1938, Nationalist forces won their first victory at Taierzhuang. but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Japan deployed about 350,000 troops to invade Wuhan and captured it in October. The Japanese achieved major military victories, but world opinion\u2014in particular in the United States\u2014condemned Japan, especially after the Panay Incident.\n\nWhat nation provided material support to China?\nOutput: Soviet Union\n\nInput: Time\nThe most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years, and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments. Atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the most common atoms used is caesium, most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations. Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom.\n\nHow long has the International System of Measurements based the second on caesium?\nOutput: Since 1967\n\nInput: Hellenistic period\nThe Celts who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios circa 270 BC. They were defeated by Seleucus I in the 'battle of the Elephants', but were still able to establish a Celtic territory in central Anatolia. The Galatians were well respected as warriors and were widely used as mercenaries in the armies of the successor states. They continued to attack neighboring kingdoms such as Bithynia and Pergamon, plundering and extracting tribute. This came to an end when they sided with the renegade Seleucid prince Antiochus Hierax who tried to defeat Attalus, the ruler of Pergamon (241\u2013197 BC). Attalus severely defeated the Gauls, forcing them to confine themselves to Galatia. The theme of the Dying Gaul (a famous statue displayed in Pergamon) remained a favorite in Hellenistic art for a generation signifying the victory of the Greeks over a noble enemy. In the early 2nd century BC, the Galatians became allies of Antiochus the Great, the last Seleucid king trying to regain suzerainty over Asia Minor. In 189 BC, Rome sent Gnaeus Manlius Vulso on an expedition against the Galatians. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BC onward.\n\nWhat battle did the Celts lose to Seleucus I?\nOutput:",

How many earrings do all of the friends have?\nA: 70\nStep-by-step reasoning process: Bellas has 100% / 25% = 4 times less earrings than Monica. This means that Monica has 10 * 4 = 40 earrings. Rachel has two times fewer earrings than Monica, which means 40 / 2 = 20 earrings. So all three friends, have a total of 10 + 40 + 20 = 70 earrings.\n\n\nQ: Salvadore earned $1956.

How many dresses can Alex make?\nA: 100\nStep-by-step reasoning process: Alex gives his friends a total of 5 friends * 20 meters of silk = 100 meters of silk. This means he has 600 \u2013 100 = 500 meters of silk left in storage. He can therefore make 500 meters of silk / 5 meters of silk per dress = 100 dresses.\n\n\nQ: Rene can finish reading 30 pages in 60 minutes.

This will reduce the burden on any one person, while also utilizing the skills of the entire team. \n\nThe third solution is to be more efficient and creative in how tasks are completed. For example, looking for shortcuts or new ways to utilize technology to quickly complete tasks, or thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems. Being creative and looking for new ways to approach the project can help to finish the project before the deadline."

The entire book is like that - mediocre (or ugly) designs, very vague, insufficient directions, and no hint of where to purchase materials.In short, don't waste your money.

As a result, prince Al-Mu'tamin flees to Castile to warn king Ferdinand of Yusufs invasion. In Castile, Rodrigo de Vivar is living a life of privilege as the son of a nobleman. He is best friends with prince Sancho and is secretly in a romantic relationship with Jimena, the daughter of count Gormaz. Unfortunately, Gormaz disapproves, and suggests that Jimena should marry the arrogant and self-centered count Ordo\u00c3\u00b1ez. As the royal court receives word that the Almoravids of Zaragoza had crossed the Castilian border, Rodrigo gets the opportunity to accompany Sancho, Ordo\u00c3\u00b1es and Gormaz on a scouting mission. Once they set up camp, Gormaz is ambushed by Al-Mu'tamin and his warriors, but Rodrigo intervenes. Once Al-Mu'tamin gets the chance to speak, he is allowed by Sancho to accompany them back to the palace. Some time later, king Ferdinand dies, and the devious and power-hungry princess Urraca plots to have Sancho killed so that the weak-minded prince Alfonso can be crowned. Gormaz meets with Rodrigo on a balcony, on Jimenas request, where Rodrigo asks for her hand in marriage. Gormaz refuses, and instead challenges Rodrigo to a swordfight. Rodrigo is hesitant to fight, but when Gormaz insists, he draws his sword. As the two fight, Urraca sends out her lover and servant to assassinate Sancho by stabbing him in the back with a dagger. At the same time, Rodrigo accidentally kills Gormaz. When Jimena witnesses, she vows to never speak to Rodrigo ever again, and he is forced to flee the scene.

Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...\nA:",

The platform could also allow users to upload their resumes, cover letters, and other supporting documents.\n\nNext, employers would post job openings on the platform, detailing the requirements, duties, and expectations for the position. The system's AI algorithms would then analyze the data provided by both job seekers and employers to identify potential matches.\n\nThe AI could use natural language processing to understand the skills and requirements listed in job descriptions, and machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns and make connections between job seekers' skills and employers' needs. The platform could also factor in job seekers' geographic location, salary expectations, and other preferences when identifying potential matches.\n\nOnce potential matches have been identified, the system would notify both job seekers and employers. Job seekers could then apply for the job directly through the platform, and employers could review their applications and schedule interviews.\n\nThe system's AI could also provide personalized recommendations to job seekers, such as suggesting specific skills or courses to improve their chances of finding the right job. Additionally, the platform could use predictive analytics to identify trends in the job market and inform job seekers about in-demand skills and emerging opportunities.\n\nOverall, this AI-powered system would provide a more efficient, personalized, and data-driven way for job seekers and employers to connect, helping to streamline the job search process and improve employment outcomes."

    "instruction": "how to graft tomato and why?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Grafting is a technique used in horticulture to join two plants together so that they grow as a single plant. In the case of tomatoes, grafting can be used to combine the root system of a strong, disease-resistant tomato plant with the above-ground growth of a tomato variety that has desirable traits, such as improved flavor or higher yields. This can help to improve the overall health and productivity of the plant.\n\nTo graft a tomato plant, you will need to carefully cut the top growth (called the \"scion\") of the desired tomato variety and the root system (called the \"rootstock\") of a strong, healthy plant. The two plants are then joined together using a technique called \"whip and tongue\" grafting, which involves making a tongue-shaped cut in the rootstock and a matching cut in the scion, and then joining them together so that they fit like a puzzle. The grafted plants are then held in place with tape or grafting clips until they have healed and begun to grow together as a single plant.\n\nThere are several reasons why tomato growers might choose to graft their plants. For example, grafting can help to improve the vigor and productivity of the plant, as well as increase its resistance to disease and pests. Grafting can also allow growers to grow multiple varieties of tomatoes on the same rootstock, which can be helpful for those who want to experiment with different flavors and colors in their garden. Additionally, because grafted plants are typically stronger and healthier than non-grafted plants, they may be less likely to suffer from transplant shock and other problems that can affect tomato plants."

The date of 1804 on the title page is probably when the plates were begun, but the poem was printed c. 1808. Today it is best known as the anthem \"Jerusalem\", with music written by Sir Hubert Parry in 1916. It is not to be confused with another poem, much longer and larger in scope, but also by Blake, called Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: who wrote the music for the hymn jerusalem?\nCoT: The relevant information is: Today it is best known as the anthem \"Jerusalem\", with music written by Sir Hubert Parry in 1916.\n\n\nAns: MgSO 7H O\nQues: Magnesium sulfate is an inorganic salt with the formula MgSO (H O) where 0 \u2264 x \u2264 7.

The overall global annual usage in the mid-1970s of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons, of which the majority was used in agriculture.\n\nAnswer this question: what is the chemical formula of epsom salt?\nCoT: This is the relevant information: It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (MgSO 7H O), commonly called Epsom salt.\n\n\nAns: Mark - Paul Harry Gosselaar\nQues: Mark-Paul Harry Gosselaar (/ \u02c8\u0261\u0252sl\u0259r /; born March 1, 1974) is an American actor. He is known for his television roles as Zack Morris in Saved by the Bell, Detective John Clark in NYPD Blue, and Peter Bash in Franklin & Bash.\n\nAnswer this question: who played zack from saved by the bell?\nCoT: To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: He is known for his television roles as Zack Morris in Saved by the Bell, Detective John Clark in NYPD Blue, and Peter Bash in Franklin & Bash.\n\n\nAnswer: Foodstuffs ( NZ ) Ltd. Now, what could be the question and solution-maybe?\nQues: Passage: Foodstuffs (NZ) Ltd is a group of two New Zealand grocery and liquor retailers' cooperatives based in the North Island and the South Island that collectively control an estimated 53 % of the New Zealand grocery market. The group owns retail franchises Four Square, New World and Pak'nSave, in-store private labels Pam's and Budget, and a ten percent stake in The Warehouse. The effective duopoly in New Zealand's supermarket industry means that Foodstuffs' only real competitor is Australian supermarket chain Progressive Enterprises.\n\nQuestion: Based on this passage, who owns new world and pak n save?\nCoT: The relevant information is: The group owns retail franchises Four Square, New World and Pak'nSave, in-store private labels Pam's and Budget, and a ten percent stake in The Warehouse.\n\n\nAns: the site of Nero 's lake\nQues: Passage: Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were located on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre; in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome.\n\nQuestion: Based on this passage, what was the colosseum built on top of?\nCoT: The relevant information is: Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use.\n\n\nAns: Jonathan Mayhew",

    "instruction": "Input: Read this: In the subtractive color system, used in painting and color printing, green is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. On the HSV color wheel, also known as the RGB color wheel, the complement of green is magenta; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light (one of the purples). On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the complementary color to green is considered to be red.\nQuestion: What is another name for the color wheel using the subtractive system?\n\nOutput: unanswerable\n\nQUES: Spielberg's film Munich, about the events following the 1972 Munich Massacre of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being Schindler's List). The film is based on Vengeance, a book by Canadian journalist George Jonas. It was previously adapted into the 1986 made-for-TV film Sword of Gideon. The film received strong critical praise, but underperformed at the U.S. and world box-office; it remains one of Spielberg's most controversial films to date. Munich received five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture, Film Editing, Original Music Score (by John Williams), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg. It was Spielberg's sixth Best Director nomination and fifth Best Picture nomination.\n\nWhat was 'Munich' about?\nWhat is the answer?\nANS: the 1972 Munich Massacre of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games\n\nQUES: After the German occupation of France in 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the entry of the Soviet Union to the war in 1941. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill successfully lobbied President Franklin D. Roosevelt for military aid from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask Congress to commit the country to war. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, which included the statement that \"the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live\" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.\nWhich British Prime Minister signed the Atlantic Charter?\n\nANS: Churchill\n\nBetween the 1992\u201393 season and the 2012\u201313 season, Premier League clubs had won the UEFA Champions League four times (as well as supplying five of the runners-up), behind Spain's La Liga with six wins, and Italy's Serie A with five wins, and ahead of, among others, Germany's Bundesliga with three wins (see table here). The FIFA Club World Cup (or the FIFA Club World Championship, as it was originally called) has been won by Premier league clubs once (Manchester United in 2008), and they have also been runners-up twice, behind Brazil's Brasileir\u00e3o with four wins, and Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A with two wins each (see table here).\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): How many times have Premier League teams been runners up in the World Cup?\nAh, so.. they have also been runners-up twice,\n\nQuestion: Jessica Sanchez received the fewest number of votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their \"save\" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, Colton Dixon was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.\nTry to answer this question if possible: Which contestant was saved by the judges on season 11 of American Idol?\nAnswer: Jessica Sanchez\n\nQuestion: The francophone Swiss Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer produced comic strips beginning in 1827, and published theories behind the form. Cartoons appeared widely in newspapers and magazines from the 19th century. The success of Zig et Puce in 1925 popularized the use of speech balloons in European comics, after which Franco-Belgian comics began to dominate. The Adventures of Tintin, with its signature clear line style, was first serialized in newspaper comics supplements beginning in 1929, and became an icon of Franco-Belgian comics.\nTry to answer this question if possible: What comics began to dominate in Europe?\nAnswer:",

Even now your aspirations may have changed from when you were in primary school. However, it seems career options aren't only based on personal taste. In a survey carried out by Teens, doctors, lawyers, and bankers were some of most popular careers that people said they hoped to follow. This is in line with a similar survey carried out in the UK in May 2011 by job website monster. Co.uk, in which medicine was the top choice among UK teenagers aged between 13 and 17. Medicine and law are two of the oldest and best known professions. Their prestige   may come from the fact that doctors and lawyers are some of the most esteemed members of society, and they make good money. Joining these high-profile professions is often seen as a sign of upward social mobility. It is equally unsurprising that banking is now one of the most common career choices. Youngsters worldwide think of banking and see the money rolling in. Wealth is increasingly becoming one of the most important indicators of a successful career. British young men list the UK tycoon Alan Sugar, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as their top role models \"for their wealth\". Just as Chinese teenagers see being a banker as a good and fun pathway to \"wealth\". However, not every child has the makings of doctor, lawyer, or banker. They are those who see fulfillment and happiness in other areas, and many teenagers dare to ink more individuality into their career options. As the Teens' survey discovered, a variety of unconventional jobs---coffee shop owner, gourmet ,waiter at a fast food restaurant---are among teenagers' career choices.

But they wouldn't all immediately lose their status. Instead, the process of expirations will continue for more than two years if Congress fails to act within six months, as President Trump has demanded. Trump announced that his administration would grant no new applications for DACA if they were received after September 5 and would let existing two-year permits expire. But the administration is also allowing anyone whose permits expire in the next six months a brief window to renew, a move designed to give Congress time to act before any DACA status is actually lost.As many as 983 undocumented people previously covered under DACA would lose their protected status every day154,000 individuals have until just Oct. 5 to submit renewal applications\"Congress, get ready to do your job,\" Trump tweeted just hours before the decision was unveiled",

It returns a list of MongoDB queries that can be used to filter the documents in a collection.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example and does not handle all possible cases and variations of SQL queries. In a real-world scenario, you may need to implement additional logic and error handling to support more complex SQL queries."

Title: Slight Case of Overbombing ~ Sisters of Mercy Review: Andrew Eldritch is a truly tallented artist and a good lyricists. I love the lyrics for temple of love (1992) and this is a truly one of his greatest tracks and having the vocals of Ofra Haza makes it an even better track. Edlritch is an underappreciated vocalist and his unique and different sounding vocals fit this kind of music perfect. There are so many amazing tracks on this greatest hits compilation, but if I had to pick a few then it has to be under the gun, doctor jeep and temple of love (1992). The book-let is quite nice and the logo is awesome as usual. However, the text is like miniscule and it is quite hard to read.

Title: Not very scholarly Review: Although this book gives an interesting snapshot of the state of Korea during the 1890's, I found the perspective to be a bit dated. Bird is a layperson describing events and accordingly provides a superficial account of Koream events. This is also a perspective of a Victorian lady with all the prejudices of that bygone era. The book is amusing from that perspective and is more like a novel; but it is hardly a scientic or sholarly study--if you are looking for a more scholarly work in your study of Korea and its history at this time you might instead look to more a recently published work and written from someone with appropriate educational background and training.Accordingly, this book should be read with a grain of salt as it is written by a layperson with all prejudices of a bygone Victorian era. It is hardly historical. It is perhaps like reading WWII American accounts of the Japanese empire and its people and taking that as the historical perspective.

Title: Better than Earwig, but it's no Strong Reaction Review: This album is MUCH better than Earwig, but nothing they do will EVER match the intensity and feeling of Strong Reaction/Three Chord Monte.

Title: Nice Pack Review: As others have commented wicked number of straps etc, make this bag very versatile. The shoulder and waist straps are well made and adjustable for a good fit. It's a lightweight but sturdy bag due to the light frame. Generally strong construction, though I noticed one of the stops on the bungee material came off. It was a quick fix. Holds a good amount of clothing, etc, but not overly big. There is a pass through from the main area to the bottom access area. For the price, highly recommended. Answer:\nAnswer:",

Many prominent Republicans, including conservative radio host Larry Elder, attempted to unseat him. However, early results showed that a majority of California voters chose to keep Newsom in office.

    "instruction": "*Question*\nTitle: Wizard: I Still Don't Know Who Tesla Really Was Review: I was hoping this book would have delved into Tesla's inventions more thoroughly. I was very disappointed in this aspect of the book. The author totally glossed over the Niagara Falls project, which was a major part of Tesla's contribution to electrical distribution. The book spends too much time on Tesla's failed business dealings and with all the secondary people that he seemingly had contact with throughout his life. The organization of the book also is disconcerting at times. You finish one paragraph and then the next paragraph is about a completely different subject, person, topic, etc. with absolutely no transition or introduction.I expected more from this book. I feel I still don't know who Tesla was or what exactly his inventions were and for a project that took 20 years of the author's life, it is still lacking in important details. Is the review positive or negative?\n**Answer**\nNegative\n\n*Question*\nTitle: This is my favorite of all Cookbooks Review: I love this book. After using it for two years I bought one for each of my sisters, and for a few friends. Everyone loves it. The food is always healthy, the flavors are distinct and the recipes are very easy to follow. Nush-e-jan! -liese Is the review positive or negative?\n**Answer**\nPositive\n\n*Question*\nTitle: Not very well made Review: I just received this case. It came damaged with a big gouge on the side along with cracked plastic that surrounds the hole the handle goes through. The telescoping handle doesn't stay up well. You put a little pressure on it and it slips all the way down. I had to return the case because of the damage and chose not to get a replacement because I found it too cheaply made. Is the review positive or negative?\n**Answer**\nNegative\n\n*Question*\nTitle: Great Icing Review: This frosting is great, especially if you want to use black but don't want it to taste bitter. The only thing I don't understand is the price. This frosting is $1.50 a tube at Wal-Mart. Is the review positive or negative?\n**Answer**",

Mindfulness can be practiced during meditation, but it can also be practiced throughout the day, while eating, walking, or doing other activities.\n\nIn summary, meditation is a specific practice, often used for relaxation, stress reduction or spiritual growth, while mindfulness is a way of being, a state of awareness and non-judgmental attention to the present moment that can be incorporated into everyday life.

    "instruction": "In this task, you are given a set of reviews from Amazon and Yelp. Your task is to generate a summary of a given set of reviews about the information present in reviews. This generated summary should reflect users' common opinions expressed in the reviews, the common sentiment of the opinions and their details, and should be coherent with the given set of reviews in terms of sentence and information structure. Avoid creating summaries that (i) contains additional information which is not present in reviews, (ii) look exactly like the review, and (iii) uses 5 or more same consecutive words or phrases given in the reviews.\n\nInput:\nReview_1: The only thing I would like to see is an aux cord when I don't want to charge my phone, but It's not a huge deal. The sound is great, and worth the money. The remote works with your phone, and that's precisely what I wanted, Review_2: you need to buy an adaptor for Ipod Nano's so it was disappointing when my son opened it up on Christmas and could not use it for his Ipod Nano. It does not state that anywhere on the box or when I ordered it., Review_3: Love, love, love the ability to save multiple preset radio stations, and the sound is clear, crisp... amazing! It almost makes waking up a pleasure. Another feature I never thought I wanted, but really appreciate, is the ability to set the brightness of the clock readout. Brilliant!, Review_4: The sound of the radio is of real quality. I also like having the two separate alarms and the alarm is not obnoxious yet still wakes us up. My wife charges her iphone on it regularly and works out well. We like the Sony so much I got one for my son and his wife for a Christmas present, Review_5: I was looking quite awhile to locate a decent sounding radio / iPod player which would also charge my iPod. This is perfect for our family. It's a lot smaller than I thought, which is good. And when we update to an iPhone 5, there is a $5 adapter to get so we can still use this radio. Perfect!, Review_6: As always, Sony has a 'winner' in this combined am / fm radio and docking station. Great sound, looks good and wife is very pleased as she put it in her craft work area. Finding the combo of am / fm wasn't easy either.Lots of fm only units. This is a great product., Review_7: My husband really like this speaker... LOVE IT! Its so easy to operate by setting the alarm.. I like the way when you put your iphone 4s to the dock its charge at the same time while you are you using it...! Great product, Review_8: While I like the Dream Machine I don't know why there's so much static. It's nearly impossible to get a couple of my favorite radio stations without constant static in the background. My other radio doesn't do that. I've even tried different locations for it. That's a big disappointment and shortcoming of the product.\nOutput:\nThis Sony radio is very high quality. The sound is very clear and crisp, almost as if it's live. The charging station is very useful for charging an iPhone or iPod, but an adapter is required for a Nano. The preset stations, clock, and alarm are useful additional features that help make it a great product.\n\nInput:\nReview_1: The only thing I would like to see is an aux cord when I don't want to charge my phone, but It's not a huge deal.

The sound is amazing, the alarm clock is not annoying, and the design looks great! It would be nice to have a place to use an aux cord and certain apple products require a $5 adapter to use the docking station but other than that, this product is fantastic!\n\nInput:\nReview_1: Regretfully the package arrived in a plastic bag with a note on it telling us that the Post Office cares. The bottle had been completely crushed in bag it was sent in, so we never got to use it.The bag of liquid did smell great though!!!, Review_2: I tried this on both a cotton t-shirt, and a polyester dress shirt, and it worked quite well, and very quick; almost effortless. Just spray it on, and smooth it with your fingers.The product says it can be used in the place of starch, but my wife tried it when ironing, and it didn't help at all., Review_3: i WOULD NOT RISK BUYING THIS ITEM. WAS DELIVERED TODAY. THE PACKAGE WAS COMPLETELY SOAKED AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN ANY SPRAY BOTTLE. I WILL BE ASKING FOR FULL REFUND.Amazon gave me a full credit when I chatted with them. I can't review since I didn't get any to try., Review_4: I really do not like to iron. I still have a scar from my last attempt. I love this product. I just spray onto my cotton shirt and smooth, then allow to dry about 30-60 minutes. There is an obvious reduction in wrinkles. No, it is not perfect, but it is presentable., Review_5: My wife and I tried this on a few items but it didn't work that great. I still have a lot of the bottle left so I'll keep on trying, but if we want it done right we still turn to the iron first. I do, however, really like how it takes away the static electricity buildup., Review_6: I love this stuff. It works on every types of clothing from jeans to tshirts and dress shirts. Spray a little on an work the wrinkle out with your hand! Just don't overspray. We take this on vacation so we don't have to waster our time ironing!, Review_7: Woohoo what a great product. A few sprays and the wrinkles disappear from your teeshirts and dress shirts. It has a little trouble with clothing like dress pants and also it didn't work on removing wrinkles from my curtains. That said, this baby has saved me hours of ironing, and I'm super happy with this purchase., Review_8: This is a wonderful wrinkle release product. Just spray it on your fabric, any fabric smooth the product in with hands smoothing out wrinkles and let dry. Goodbye iron. I will definitely take it on my next vacation. It removes wrinkles and makes clothes smell fresh, I love it.\nOutput:",

    "output": "While it's not full proof, this spray is great at reducing the number of wrinkles in cotton and polyester materials. It's less effective on thicker materials. It's quick and easy to use, and it has a nice scent. It's a good thing to bring on vacation to freshen up packed clothes. Just be aware, the bottle is prone to leaking!"

For example, a task may require predicting all labels that describe the contents of an image such as, \u201csports\u201d, \u201coutdoors\u201d, \u201cindoors\u201d. Such tasks can be solved by multi-label classification models which are made up of multiple classifiers that each handle one label. The input example is first classified by a base model that predicts the most likely labels. Subsequently, the labels which have a confidence score above a certain threshold are chosen by the model. The multi-label classification model can learn correlations between related labels and can even predict layers of labels like a taxonomy."

    "input": "",
    "output": "When choosing an electric vehicle, there are many factors to consider.  Before we get into those specific factors, let's take a quick look at the broader electric vehicle market to provide context for your choice of an electric vehicle.\n\nThe global vehicle market has made an intentional transition from combustion engine vehicles to electric powered vehicles. In that transition, here are some things to consider:\n1. This transition will continue to take place through 2030 - 2035.  This is the timeframe most of the traditional automotive original equipment manufacturers have declared that they will be 100% transitioned to electric vehicle production.  This is important because you can assume that the technology behind the electrification of automobiles will be evolving and improving over this time period.\n2. Tesla was the company that disrupted the automotive market by producing, marketing and servicing the first all-electric vehicles.  Today they have the lead in most vehicles sold in the all-electric vehicle category.  If your only criteria for choosing your electric vehicle is to choose a vehicle from the leader, you have your answer in Tesla.\n3. Fast followers to Tesla fall into two very broad categories that are important to consider in your choice of an electric vehicle:\n     1. Traditional automotive original equipment manufactures - These are the companies that have been in business of producing, marketing and servicing combustion engine vehicles. In this category, think of General Motors, Ford, Toyota, VW, BMW, Kia, Stellantis and the like.  These companies have expertise in large scale production, quality control, after sale servicing, warranty management, customer experience and have large R&D teams that have been studying vehicle electrification for many years.  In addition, they have a large dealership network to distribute and service their vehicles for your convenience.  \n     2. Startup companies - These are the companies that have recently entered the market, following Tesla's lead, in starting their own brand of all-electric vehicles.  In this category, think of Rivian, Canoo, Fisker, Arrival and Vinfast among others.  They lack the large scale production experience, facilities and employee mass of the traditional automotive manufacturers.  However, typically their strength is in being able to nimbly change, adapt, attract expertise from the automotive market and have incentives to attract customers.\n\nGiven the backdrop of the broader vehicle market, now here are some factors to consider:\n    1. Miles per charge - With is typically categorized as \"Range\". The median driving range of all-electric vehicles in 2021 is 234 miles per charge.  This factor  matters if you take long trips between convenient charges.  You also can inference that vehicles that have a range much under 234 miles per charge may not have high quality batteries.\n    2. Charging Stations - You never needed to consider this factor when buying a traditional vehicle, unless the vehicle was powered by some obscure fuel.  Now, this factor is very important to research.  You will want to consider the number of charging stations available in your area, the time per charge and options for home charging.\n    3. Maintenance and Warranty - if something does happen to your vehicle, how easy is it to find a certified center to get your repairs quickly and conveniently accomplished.\n    4. All the same factors if you were buying a traditional automotive - Price, Size, Style and incentives available for the purchase.\n\nIf you keep these factors in mind, you should have a good experience in choosing your all-electric vehicle."

    "instruction": "Task: What can you tell me about about the Landscape Arch in Arches National Park in Utah?\nInput: The arch is among many in the Devils Garden area in the north of the park. Landscape Arch was named by Frank Beckwith who explored the area in the winter of 1933\u20131934 as the leader of an Arches National Monument scientific expedition. The arch can be reached by a 0.8 mi (1.3 km) graded gravel trail.\n\nThe Natural Arch and Bridge Society (NABS) considers Landscape Arch the fifth longest natural arch in the world, after four arches in China. In 2004, the span of Landscape Arch was measured at 290.1 ft (88.4 m), \u00b10.8 ft (0.24 m), with a height of 77.5 ft (23.6 m). NABS measured the span of the slightly shorter Kolob Arch in Zion National Park at 287 ft (87 m) in 2006.\n\nThe most recent recorded rockfall events occurred in the 1990s when one large slab fell in 1991 and then two additional large rockfalls occurred in 1995. Since the rockfalls, the trail beneath the arch has been closed.\nOutput:",

With its easy application and quick results, it's no wonder more and more people are turning to this convenient and effective solution. In this article, we'll dive into the world of instant tanning lotions and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.\n\n**What is Instant Tanning Lotion?**\n\nInstant tanning lotion is a type of self-tanning product that is designed to provide immediate results. Unlike traditional self-tanners that can take hours or even days to fully develop, instant tanning lotions give you a natural-looking tan in a matter of minutes.\n\nThese lotions typically contain a tinted formula that provides an instant bronzing effect on the skin. The formula also contains active ingredients that work to deepen and enhance the tan over time. This means you can achieve a gorgeous glow in no time, and the results can last for several days.\n\n**How to Choose the Right Instant Tanning Lotion**\n\nWhen it comes to choosing an instant tanning lotion, there are several factors to consider. Here are some tips to help you find the perfect product for your needs:\n\n1. **Skin Tone:** Choose a product that is designed for your specific skin tone. Many instant tanning lotions come in a range of shades to suit different skin tones, so make sure to select one that will complement your natural coloring.\n2. **Ingredients:** Look for a formula that contains nourishing ingredients such as aloe vera, vitamin E, and coconut oil. These ingredients will help to moisturize and soothe your skin, while also providing a natural and healthy-looking tan.\n3. **Application Method:** Consider the method of application that you prefer. Some instant tanning lotions are designed to be applied with a mitt, while others can be sprayed or rubbed on with your hands. Choose a product that fits your preferences and is easy to use.\n4. **Scent:** Some instant tanning lotions have a strong scent, while others are fragrance-free. If you're sensitive to fragrances, opt for a product that is unscented or has a light, pleasant scent.\n\n**How to Apply Instant Tanning Lotion**\n\nTo achieve the best results with your instant tanning lotion, follow these tips for a flawless application:\n\n1. **Exfoliate:** Before applying the lotion, make sure to exfoliate your skin. This will remove dead skin cells and provide a smooth canvas for the product to adhere to.\n2. **Moisturize:** Apply a lightweight moisturizer to any dry areas, such as elbows, knees, and ankles. This will help the lotion to glide on smoothly and prevent any streaks or patches.\n3. **Apply the Lotion:** Use a tanning mitt or your hands to apply the lotion in a circular motion. Make sure to cover all areas evenly, and blend well to avoid any streaks or lines.\n4. **Wash Your Hands:** After applying the lotion, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly to prevent staining.\n5. **Let it Dry:** Allow the lotion to dry for a few minutes before getting dressed. This will prevent any transfer onto clothing or furniture.\n\n**Benefits of Using Instant Tanning Lotion**\n\nThere are several benefits to using instant tanning lotion, including:\n\n1. **Quick Results:** With instant tanning lotion, you can achieve a beautiful, sun-kissed glow in a matter of minutes. This makes it a great option for those who want a quick and easy way to enhance their complexion.\n2. **Long-Lasting:** The results of instant tanning"

    "input": "",
    "output": "The Phillips Curve is a graphical representation of the inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation in an economy. The curve is named after the economist A.W. Phillips, who first observed the relationship between the two variables in the 1950s.\n\nThe logic behind the Phillips Curve is based on the idea that there is a trade-off between unemployment and inflation in the short run. The curve shows that when unemployment is low, there tends to be upward pressure on wages and prices, which leads to higher inflation. Conversely, when unemployment is high, there is downward pressure on wages and prices, which leads to lower inflation.\n\nThe curve suggests that there is an optimal level of unemployment, known as the natural rate of unemployment, at which inflation is stable. When unemployment is below this level, inflation tends to increase, and when it is above this level, inflation tends to decrease. This is because at the natural rate of unemployment, there is enough slack in the labor market to prevent wages and prices from rising too quickly or falling too much.\n\nThe Phillips Curve has been the subject of much debate and criticism over the years, particularly in light of the stagflation of the 1970s, which challenged the inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. Nevertheless, it remains an important tool for understanding the relationship between these two key macroeconomic variables in the short run."

He approaches the commander of the brig, explaining that he wants a dozen of his worst prisoners for latrine duty. This \"dirty dozen\" group of criminals that the brig commander selects are a motley assortment of men, ranging from the cowardly clerk Oliver Quill (Kenny Miller) to the hardened and dangerous Dockman (Leo Gordon). Not until McGrath orders a helicopter to fly him, his Korean guide Pak (Dale Ishimoto), and the dozen prisoners to their destination, does anyone get suspicious and follow up with the base commander. The actual mission was to target a critical North Korean mountain tunnel, but the men who were originally assigned to go with McGrath were still waiting at the base. The base commander is furious at McGrath, but he calls for the air support that he knows McGrath and his men will need.Almost immediately upon being dropped behind enemy lines, McGrath and his men encounter a group of North Korean soldiers approaching in a vehicle. Two of the men decide they want nothing to do with engaging those soldiers, or carrying out the mission McGrath tricked them into going on, so they run. A third prisoner yells at them to stop, which alerts the North Koreans, who open up and shoot and kill the two runners.

Now, what could be the question and solution-maybe?\nQues: The denomination of two dollars was authorized under a congressional act, and first used in March 1862. The denomination was continuously used until the 1960s; by this time the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency the two-dollar bill was assigned to. In 1966 it was decided to discontinue production of all United States Notes, which included the two-dollar bill. The two-dollar denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued; the Treasury Department cited the two-dollar bill's low use and unpopularity as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination. In 1976, production of the two-dollar denomination was resumed and the two-dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note, with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello. It has remained a current denomination since then. It was estimated that if the two-dollar bill replaced approximately half of the one-dollar bills in circulation, the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ($112 million adjusted for inflation) over the period from 1976 to 1981, due to reduced production, storage, and shipping costs.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: when did the first 2 dollar bill come out?\nCoT: The relevant information is: The denomination of two dollars was authorized under a congressional act, and first used in March 1862.\n---\nAnswer: 1850. Now, what could be the question and solution-maybe?\nQues: Telecommunications in India began with the introduction of the telegraph. The Indian postal and telecom sectors are one of the worlds oldest. In 1850, the first experimental electric telegraph line was started between Calcutta and Diamond Harbour. In 1851, it was opened for the use of the British East India Company.

In the condition genu valgum (knock knee) the femurs converge so much that the knees touch one another. The opposite extreme is genu varum (bow-leggedness).

    "output": "Sure! To solve this problem, we can use the law of conservation of energy. The initial potential energy of the ball is equal to its final kinetic energy after impact.\n\nThe initial potential energy is given by:\n\nU = mgh, where m is the mass of the ball, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the relative height.\n\nThe final kinetic energy is given by:\n\nK = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed of the ball immediately after impact.\n\nSetting U = K, we have:\n\nmgh = (1/2)mv^2\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2gh)\n\nSo the speed of the ball immediately after impact is equal to the square root of 2 times the acceleration due to gravity times the relative height of the ball."
