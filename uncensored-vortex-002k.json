He was taken to hospital for treatment to a hand injury.\nThe Falls of Lora are a set of overfalls which form white water rapids when a particularly high tide runs out from the loch.\n\nSum: A man has been rescued after his motorboat got caught in strong currents at Connel Bridge near Oban.\n\n\nQ: The blaze, which broke out about a mile from Montcliffe Quarry on George's Lane near Horwich, was spotted by a pilot at about 15:55 BST.\nGreater Manchester Fire and Rescue said it was a \"significant wildfire\" and 10 engines from Greater Manchester and Lancashire were deployed.\nThe fire was brought under control shortly after 21:00 BST.\nWinter Hill lies between Bolton and Darwen in Lancashire, and hosts a television and radio mast.\n\nA: Firefighters tackled a fire on moorland at Winter Hill in Lancashire for more than five hours.\n\n\nArticle: Huddersfield photographer Golcar Matt snapped the cloud in the East Midlands and submitted it to the BBC Weather Watchers website.\nBBC Weather presenter Alina Jenkins said it was a common cumulus cloud, which can often be seen forming shapes in the sky.\n\"They're formed by the sun heating the air at the surface,\" she said.\n\"The air then rises and as it does it cools and condenses to create the \"cotton wool\" type clouds which often take on interesting shapes.\nMore breaking stories from BBC Yorkshire\n\"How many times have you thought one looks like an elephant or a train for example?\"\nShe added: \"It would have been quite a bit larger earlier in the afternoon but once we started to lose some of the daytime heating it began to break up and for a short time looked like a map of the UK.\"\nCommenting on the photograph on Facebook, Andrew Yeung said:  \"This is how Hard Brexit will look,\" while Dru Lawson said: \"Leaked pics of the UK doing a Brexit.\"\nChristopher Broadbent said:  \"I know what it's meant to look like but all I can see is the ghost in the original Ghostbuster film in the opening library scene.\"\nThe photograph follows other recent interesting captures of our skies, including one of a cloud shaped like Concorde and a rare lunar rainbow, called a moonbow.\n++++++++++\nSummarize:",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Yes, I can provide an example of how to create a WhatWG ReadableStream that returns a stream of random bytes of configurable size. Here's one way to do it using the `ReadableStream` constructor:\n```javascript\nclass RandomByteStream {\n  constructor(size) {\n    this._size = size;\n  }\n\n  async *generate() {\n    let remaining = this._size;\n    while (remaining > 0) {\n      // Generate random bytes using crypto.getRandomValues()\n      const chunkSize = Math.min(remaining, 1024);\n      const buffer = new Uint8Array(chunkSize);\n      window.crypto.getRandomValues(buffer);\n      remaining -= chunkSize;\n      yield buffer;\n    }\n  }\n\n  async start(controller) {\n    for await (const chunk of this.generate()) {\n      controller.enqueue(chunk);\n    }\n    controller.close();\n  }\n}\n\nconst randomStream = new ReadableStream(new RandomByteStream(10000));\n```\nIn this example, the `RandomByteStream` class takes a size parameter in its constructor and generates chunks of random bytes using the `crypto.getRandomValues()` method. The `start()` method is called when the stream is started, and it enqueues chunks of random bytes until the desired size is reached. Finally, the controller is closed to signal the end of the stream.\n\nYou can configure the size of the stream by passing a different value to the `RandomByteStream` constructor. In this example, the stream will return 10,000 random bytes."

Carrie Underwood in a Michael Kors wool cr\u00eape dress and Kenneth Jay Lane link bracelet. 1. Always look the part . Most of the time I slap on some makeup in the morning so I don't look bad if somebody snaps a picture. Somebody, somewhere, will catch you, even if it's a fan at the grocery store. Very rarely do I go out without makeup. 2. Keep a food diary . I'm OCD like that. I count calories, fat and fiber--which is important in making you feel fuller faster--and protein, especially when I'm working out.  Watch how Carrie handles romantic distress \u00bb . 3. Don't be a dairy queen . Cheese is ruining my life! I'm trying to talk myself into being lactose-intolerant. I mean, it's basically moldy milk, and it doesn't smell that great--but it's so good! Oh, jeez, I'm thinking about it now... 4. Exercise your options . Always take an hour for yourself to go do something positive. I like the elliptical machine or swimming if I'm in a hotel with a decent pool and there aren't too many people there. I also do the treadmill, free weights, exercise ball. If it's a nice day, outdoor activity is nice. I get a bike and ride around. Plus, I get a decent cardio workout every night onstage. 5. Don't break the bank . I don't buy expensive jewelry and fur coats and Escalades. I've never bought a car in my life. The car I have, a Ford Mustang convertible, is the one I won on Idol--I guess I need to go buy a new car after all! 6. Smell yummy . I don't do smelly soaps or wear perfume, so lotion is kind of my perfume. My favorite body lotion is Benefit's Maybe Baby. It's got a little shimmer in it. If I'm dressing up I might use perfume. I have a couple by Anna Sui. And Gwen Stefani's perfume [L], is good too. 7. Be a girlie girl . With makeup I think it's important for girls to play. I mix a lot. I'll put on lip gloss and go, \"That needs to shimmer.\" So I'll put something shimmery on top. Then I want it a little pinker, so I put pink on top. But it all comes together. I'm trying to lay off the black eyeliner, though--I love it a little too much. 8. Go with the flow . I tend to go after bigger, flowy tops or dresses. I know I'm doing myself a disservice, but I'd rather put on a muumuu and have people at least think there might be a skinny person underneath than put on something tight and have them think, Look at that gut! 9. Laugh at yourself . Usually I come up through the floor to get to the stage. I can't stand up on the little platform or the audience will see me, so I'm squatting down with my rear end pressed up against the back of it. I just laugh because the audience thinks this is so glamorous--and here I am under the stage with these ropes and equipment, my butt pressed against plastic! E-mail to a friend .

In total, Elisa paints 30 + 60 + 15 = 105 square feet of wall.\nThe question and answer:\nQuestion and answer: On Monday Elisa paints 30 square feet of her house's walls. On Tuesday she paints twice that amount. On Wednesday she finishes up by painting half as many square feet as she painted on Monday. How many square feet total does Elisa paint in her house?\nThe answer is 105\n\nStep-by-step reasoning process: He is washing 10 ounces of shirts because 2 x 5 = 10. He is washing 6 ounces of socks because 3 x 2 = 6. He is already washing 34 ounces of clothes because 10 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 34. He can wash 16 more ounces because 50 - 34 = 16. He can wash 4 pairs of underwear because 16 / 4 = 4.\nThe question and answer:\nQuestion and answer: Tony's dad is very strict about the washing machine and family members are only allowed to wash 50 total ounces of clothing at a time. Tony doesn't want to break the rules, so he weighs his clothes and finds that a pair of socks weighs 2 ounces, underwear weighs 4 ounces, a shirt weighs 5 ounces, shorts weigh 8 ounces, and pants weigh 10 ounces. Tony is washing a pair of pants, 2 shirts, a pair of shorts, and 3 pairs of socks.

    "output": "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule composed of two long chains of nucleotides coiled around each other in the shape of a double helix. Each nucleotide is made of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and the four nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).\n\nThe two strands of DNA are connected by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases, forming base pairs. In DNA, adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), while cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G). This complementary base pairing is consistent and results in the two strands being parallel but running in opposite directions, which is known as antiparallel.\n\nThe DNA molecule is twisted into a coiled formation, known as the double helix, with the sugar-phosphate backbone on the outside and the base pairs on the inside. This structure allows for efficient packing of DNA into the nucleus of a cell and also facilitates the processes of replication and transcription."

    "instruction": "Step 4: Lock your neutral spine in place by engaging your core.\nStep 5: Slowly and carefully push one leg back, keeping your toes pointed toward the floor, and pushing through your heel. Make sure not to arch your back, but keep the back still in neutral spine.\n\nStep 6: At the same time, slowly and carefully extend the opposite arm forward with your palm open and your thumb on top. Once your arm is fully extended, pull that shoulder blade back toward your back pocket. The muscles on top of that shoulder (upper trapezius) should not be activated. We want to activate the lats.\nStep 7: Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten seconds being the goal. Strive for maximum engagement of the lat muscle on the extended arm and the glutes on the extended leg. Switch arms and legs without moving the back.\nStep 8: Do ten reps on each position.\nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Neck pain. You are not using your lat muscles on the extended arm and are instead using your upper trapezius muscles. This causes shoulder pain. Make sure when you get into the hands and knees position that you \u201ccorkscrew\u201d the shoulder blades back before starting cat and camel.\n\u2022 Back pain. Make sure you are in neutral spine and that the core is braced. If this doesn\u2019t help alleviate pain, go to the regressions.\n\u2022 Knees hurt on the floor. Add a pillow or pad.\nCommon Mistakes\n1. Internal rotation of the shoulder with palm facing down. This does not allow proper engagement of the lats. Doing the exercise this way negates some of the most beneficial aspects of the exercise.\n2. Pointing toes behind you. This makes it much more difficult to engage the glutes of the extended leg. Again, this negates some of the most beneficial aspects of the exercise. Make sure toes are pointing toward the floor.\n3. Arching the back during leg extension/extending the neck during shoulder flexion. If your neck or lower back is moving, this means you are not stabilizing your neutral spine. If you can\u2019t accomplish this, go to the regressions and come back to this exercise later.\n4. Going through the exercise in quick reps instead of isometric holds. The exercise is meant to build endurance. Moving slowly and isometric holds are a must.\nREGRESSIONS\nShoulder Flexion in Quadruped\nIf you were unable to do the \u201cbird dog\u201d exercise and tried the troubleshooting tips with no success, try this easier exercise and then work your way back up to bird dog in time. The goals are the same.\n1. Get on your hands and knees, with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Pull both shoulder blades in toward the spine and back toward the back pockets in a \u201ccorkscrew\u201d fashion.\n2. Keep your neck in neutral with the rest of your spine. You should be looking down at the floor, not out in front of you.\n3. Go through the \u201ccat\u201d and \u201ccamel\u201d positions (see Cat/Camel Mobilization) to find your neutral spine.\n4. Lock your neutral spine in place by engaging your core.\n\n5. Slowly and carefully extend your arm forward with your palm open and your thumb on top. Once your arm is fully extended, pull that shoulder blade in toward your spine and back toward your back pockets. The muscles on top of that shoulder (upper trapezius) should not be activated. We are trying to activate the lats.\n6. Hold five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n7. Alternate arms for ten total reps on each side.\n8. Once you are able to perform this exercise regularly without pain, move on to hip extension in quadruped.\nHip Extension in Quadruped\nThis is the follow-up to the previous exercise. Once you can do this without pain or difficulty, try the full \u201cbird dog\u201d exercise again.\n1. Get on your hands and knees, with your hands under shoulders and your knees under your hips. Pull both shoulder blades in toward your spine and down toward the back pockets in a \u201ccorkscrew\u201d fashion.\n2. Keep your neck in neutral with the rest of your spine. You should be looking down at the floor, not out in front of you.\n3. Go through the \u201ccat\u201d and \u201ccamel\u201d positions to find your neutral spine (see Cat/Camel Mobilization).\n4. Lock your neutral spine in place by engaging your core.\n\n5. Slowly and carefully push one leg back, keeping your toes pointed toward the ground and pushing back through your heel. Make sure not to arch your back, but keep the back still in neutral spine.\n6. Hold for five to ten seconds, with ten being the goal.\n7. Alternate legs for ten total reps.\n8. Once you are able to complete this exercise without problems, go back and try the \u201cbird dog\u201d or opposite arm/leg extension.\nPROGRESSIONS\nOnce you are able to perform the \u201cbird dog\u201d with relative ease, you may want to try the following progressions to increase your spinal stability and fitness.\nOpposite Arm/Leg Extension on BOSU Ball\nThis exercise increases your ability to maintain spinal stability in dynamic activities and sports such as skiing, biking, or running on uneven surfaces.\n1. In the gym, locate a BOSU ball. This piece of exercise equipment is that odd-looking inflated flexible half-dome that you see in most gyms. It\u2019s round on one side and flat on the other and is usually blue. Next to it, set up a step or some other surface that is one to two inches high.\n2. Kneel with both knees on the BOSU ball and your hands on the step as shown in the picture.\n\n3. Perform opposite arm/leg extensions.\n4. You will notice that with the introduction of instability with the BOSU ball, this exercise is much more challenging.\nOpposite Arm/Leg Extension with Arm/Leg Movement\nThis exercise teaches increased spinal stability/core control while highlighting hip and shoulder movement independent of the spine.\n1. Perform opposite arm/leg extension.\n2. Once your arm and leg are extended, make sure your core is completely locked down.\n\n3. Without moving the spine or torso, make small circles with the leg, beginning in the hip joint.\n4. Do the same with the arm beginning in the shoulder joint, being careful not to move the torso.\n5. Do ten circles, then switch arm/leg.\n6. Alternate for ten reps.\n\nWell, that\u2019s it for the 7 Daily Exercises. Don\u2019t be concerned if it takes you a while to get these exercises right. And don\u2019t worry if it takes a half hour or more to do them at first. Once you become familiar with them, you will be able to do them in only ten minutes each day.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "In calculus, both infinitesimals and limits are used to study the behavior of functions and solve problems.\n\\\nInfinitesimals refer to infinitely small quantities. The idea behind infinitesimals is that you can imagine breaking up a function into an infinite number of tiny pieces, each of which is so small that it can be treated as zero. This allows you to perform calculations with these quantities, just like you would with regular numbers. However, the concept of infinitesimals was not rigorously defined until much later in the development of calculus.\n\\\nLimits, on the other hand, are a more formal and precise approach to studying functions. A limit is the value that a function approaches as its input (x-value) gets closer and closer to a certain value. For example, if you take the limit of a function as x approaches 2, you are finding the value that the function approaches as x gets closer and closer to 2.\n\\\nThe main difference between infinitesimals and limits is in their level of rigor and formality. Infinitesimals were originally used as a way of thinking about calculus problems, but were not well-defined mathematically until later. Limits, on the other hand, provide a more rigorous and formal approach to calculus that is widely accepted in modern mathematics.\n\\\nIn summary, both infinitesimals and limits can be used to solve calculus problems, but limits provide a more rigorous and widely accepted approach."

    "input": "",
    "output": "First, if the a full tire needs 500 cubic inches of air, then two empty tires need: 500 cubic inches / tire * 2 tires = 1000 cubic inches. Accordingly, the 40% - full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (100% - 40%). So, we find the 40% - full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (60%) = 300 cubic inches. And, the 70% - full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (100% - 70%). So, the 70% - full tire needs 500 cubic inches * (30%) = 150 cubic inches. Now add up the needs of all the tires to find the total number of cubic inches needed: 1000 cubic inches + 300 cubic inches + 150 cubic inches = 1450 cubic inches. Finally, if the pumps each hold 50 cubic inches, the total number of pumps needed is 1550 cubic inches / 50 cubic inches / pump = 29 pumps."

    "output": "Certainly! Here's an expanded answer:\n\nThe writer may be frustrated with the world's lack of action on climate change because it is an existential threat that affects everyone on the planet. Despite the overwhelming evidence and warnings from scientists, world leaders have been slow to take action, and the situation is becoming more dire by the day. The writer may feel a sense of urgency to act now, before it's too late.\n\nIt is essential to take immediate action on climate change because the consequences of inaction will be severe and irreversible. Rising temperatures and sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and extreme weather events will have a devastating impact on our planet and future generations. The writer may believe that we have a moral obligation to act now and protect the planet for future generations.\n\nThe longer we delay taking action, the more difficult and costly it will be to address the problem. The writer may feel frustrated that we are wasting precious time and resources arguing about the existence of climate change, rather than working together to find solutions. It is essential that we take collective action now to reduce carbon emissions, invest in renewable energy, and protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer's frustration with the world's inability to address climate change is understandable given the magnitude of the problem and the urgent need for action. Taking immediate action is crucial to protecting our planet and future generations. It is time for all of us to work together to find solutions to this global crisis."

He looked up and saw a tiny white and gray kitten stuck in the branches of the tree. The tree was too high for Jack to climb and the branches were too weak to hold him, so he had to think of another way to save the kitten. He remembered that he had an old rope in his house and ran home to get it. He quickly returned and tied the rope to the trunk of the tree and threw one end up to the kitten. Miraculously, the little kitten grabbed on and Jack pulled him down to safety. Everyone in the village cheered and Jack proudly walked back home with the rescued kitten in his arms."

If there is no answer, please output \"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\". Movie title: 12 Angry Men Context: In a New York City courthouse, an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \"not guilty\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \"rarity\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances. He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote \"guilty\" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt.Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury. Instead, he requests another vote, this time by secret ballot.

Brooke is a straight-laced, fairly strict mother who works for the US Postal Service and has been raising Bliss to be a beauty pageant contestant.Bliss is frantically trying to wash her hair and is horrified at the results. Her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) is unable to help. Looking at a bottle in her hands, Pash insists that it says its results are temporary.On the pagent stage, the girls are each giving a short explanation of why they chose the one person they could have dinner with. When Bliss is called to stage, the piano cuts short and everyone stares. Bliss' hair is a complete mess and there are noticeable streaks of blue. Brooke glares daggers at her daughter as Bliss explains why she would choose Amelia Earhart to dine with.En route back to the parking lot, Brooke grills Bliss about her actions. Bliss can only meekly say she did it on a dare, though when challenged on how it worked out, she can only answer, 'not so great.' Brooke gives a sportsman's hug and congratulations to Corbi, the winner of the pageant, who thanks her modestly and says that Bliss is difficult to beat. Brooke and Corbi's mother briefly discuss the upcoming Blue Bonnet Pageant (Brooke tousles Bliss' blue hair as a reference) before Brooke piles Bliss and younger daughter Shania (Eulala Scheel) into the car. Inside the car, Brooke tells Bliss that even if she doesn't really approve of the pageants, there's a lot she can learn from them.Brooke takes Bliss to the hair salon to get the blue dye washed out. On arrival home, Bliss' father Earl (Daniel Stern) hugs Shania on the trophy she won for her age division. He's heard about Bliss' fiasco and asks about it, and Bliss just sullenly says, 'just defective, I guess,' before going inside the house.Bliss and Pash are at work at the 'Oink Joint' BBQ diner....\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\nA beauty pageant.\n\n\nProblem: Given the question: Question: Was Gianni able to see the murderers face?

For instance, a snare drum sounds higher pitched than a bass drum though both have indefinite pitch, because its sound contains higher frequencies. In other words, it is possible and often easy to roughly discern the relative pitches of two sounds of indefinite pitch, but sounds of indefinite pitch do not neatly correspond to any specific pitch. A special type of pitch often occurs in free nature when sound reaches the ear of an observer directly from the source, and also after reflecting off a sound-reflecting surface.

An example of five consecutive doubled letters is the word voorraaddoos (food storage container). The diaeresis (Dutch: trema) is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately when involving a pre- or suffix. Whereas a hyphen is used when this problem occurs in compound words. For example; \"be\u00efnvloed\" (influenced), but zee-eend (sea duck). Generally, other diacritical marks only occur in loanwords, though the acute accent can also be used for emphasis or to differentiate between two forms.

The announcement is expected to be the first in a series of new measures Obama will propose this fall as the administration looks to jump-start an economy that the president himself has said isn't growing fast enough.\n\nIn addition to making the research credits permanent, Obama will also ask Congress to extend one of the credit options available to businesses from 14 to 17%, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the proposal has not been formally announced.\n\nObama has proposed making the research and development tax credit permanent before, as part of the budget he submitted to Congress earlier this year.\n\n\"That's where U.S. competitiveness lies in high-technology industries,\" Laura Tyson, a member of Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, said Sunday on Face the Nation on CBS.\n\n\"I don't think this is something that has ... as immediate a job impact as, say, movement on the current tax credits for the unemployed or extending a payroll tax holiday of some sort. But I think it's very important in terms of job creation over the longer term,\" Tyson said.\n\nWhile the idea is popular in Congress, coming up with offsetting tax increases or spending cuts has been a stumbling block. Obama will ask lawmakers to close corporate tax breaks for multinational corporations and oil and gas companies.\n\nCongress has previously passed research tax credits on a temporary basis. The credits expired last year and a proposal for renewal is pending in the Senate.\n\nWhile research credits generally have bipartisan support, Washington's contentious political atmosphere means the White House isn't taking anything for granted. Officials have watched other proposals they deem necessary to economic growth, including a bill to extend credit and cut taxes for small businesses, languish on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe proposal for research and development tax credits was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nAmid an uptick in the jobless rate to 9.6%, the president promised to announce a series of new measures on the economy. The package could include infrastructure bonds for municipalities and extensions for other tax breaks for businesses and individuals that expired at the end of 2009.\n\nThe administration is also considering extending a law passed in March that exempts companies that hire unemployed workers from paying Social Security taxes on those workers through December. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has proposed extending the exemption an additional six months.\n\nObama is continuing to prod the Senate to pass the small business bill that calls for about $12 billion in tax breaks and a $30 billion fund to help unfreeze lending. Republicans have likened the bill to the unpopular bailout of the financial industry. And the president wants to make permanent the portion of George W. Bush's tax cuts affecting the middle class.\n\nThe House has already passed many of the provisions, but they have stalled in the Senate because Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on how to pay for them.\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka argued for job investment as a way of putting money in the pockets of middle-class Americans and others who need it.\n\n\"We do need more credit for small- and midsized businesses so that they can start creating jobs,\" Trumka said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. \"All of that will help, but it may not be enough. Even the holiday on taxes may not be enough, the research and development tax credit may not be enough.

Who's running the pool? We've got 10 bucks that says someone will officially challenge Rahm Emanuel's residency by noon the following Monday.\n\nThe Rahm-doesn't-live-here crowd was at it even before Emanuel announced that he was coming home to run for mayor. This isn't his home any more, they say. He moved to Washington in 2009 to be chief of staff for President Barack Obama. And they say he can't claim to be a Chicagoan again now that Mayor Richard Daley is retiring.\n\nWe've heard the arguments and feel confident Emanuel is firmly and legally rooted to Chicago. That won't stop his challengers and their attorneys from making their noise. They'll have little hope of knocking him off the ballot but plenty of time to brand him an outsider and an opportunist \u2014 a carpetbagger, in other words \u2014 as they plead their case to the Chicago Board of Elections. They can keep it alive all the way to the state Supreme Court, and why not? It's a great way to change the subject when someone brings up a touchy issue like, for example, upcoming contract negotiations with Chicago Transit Authority unions.\n\nUnder Illinois' municipal code, a candidate must be a resident of the city for a year prior to the election. The code doesn't spell out a definition for residency, though it does explicitly make an exception for members of the military who serve away from home.\n\nThe state election code includes a broader \"government service exemption\" that protects the claim to residency for anyone who leaves temporarily \"on business of the United States.\" Chief of staff to the president seems to fit that bill. Courts have said that exemption protects the right to run for office as well as the right to vote, as long as the person plans to return when the job is done.\n\nDespite living in D.C., Emanuel still owns a home in Chicago and used that address to vote absentee in the Feb. 2 Democratic primary.\n\nAttorney Burt Odelson, the de facto point man for candidates contemplating an objection, argues that the government service exemption doesn't apply to White House jobs and says Emanuel gave up residency when he rented out the house and moved his family to Washington. He has no place to come home to \u2014 no place to keep a toothbrush, Odelson says \u2014 so he's not a resident.\n\nObama could run for mayor because he tags up at his Kenwood home now and then. So could Gov. Pat Quinn, who votes in Chicago even though he keeps his underwear (and, we assume, a toothbrush) at the governor's mansion in Springfield.\n\nWe haven't found any successful electoral challenges that relied on the toothbrush test. Instead, the courts have focused on determining the candidate's intent. Emanuel's White House job was temporary by definition. It doesn't matter that someone else is living in his Chicago house \u2014 why let it sit empty if he can collect rent? \u2014 and the fact that he leased it instead of selling bolsters the argument that he meant to return. That occasion came sooner rather than later, thanks to Daley, but we have to believe the possibility of running for Chicago mayor is one reason Emanuel made sure he kept an address in the city.\n\nChicago will be served by a broad and diverse field of candidates for mayor. We're glad to have a candidate with Emanuel's credentials in the race. It will be a shame, though not really a surprise, if the mayoral campaign is hijacked by candidates who want to wage a diversionary debate over whether he belongs to Chicago or Washington.\nWhat was this article about?\n++++++++++\nIt's about:",

When we got there and were seated, we were optimistic when we saw the variety of options on the menu, we were confident that we had found a new lunch spot.  Sooooo at 12:05 we still hadn't receive my chicken Caesar wrap with sweet potatoes waffle fries or my friend's grilled chicken salad.  Nor had we seen the waitress or bus boy to refresh our drinks, that was until they walked into the room from some obscure place together after a half hour. . .We flagged them both down asked for drink refills twice and to please check on our meals as we were on our lunch hour.  Out came my meal with waffle fries that were not even warm to the touch. I sent them back and ate half of my wrap.  It had kind of an odd taste but I attribute it to strong feta cheese.  My friend asked for no dressing with her salad but asked for vinegar . . . The waitress brought her a bottle with about a quarter inch of brown liquid in it and said this is vinegar.  It wasn't.  It was soy sauce, so that went back. . .  We asked to talk to the manager; we had to ask four people to speak to the manager until he finally begrudgingly came over.  He began with \"You are already unhappy so there is nothing I can say to make it better\"  That is it. . .He would not even take care of the worse meal I have ever eaten in my life. . .which lead to 3 days of major illness.  STAY AWAY.\n\n\nProblem: What would be an example of an negative (OPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive) review?\n\nAnswer:",

It was my first time here and I heard great things so I was excited to check it out, but our waitress was awful and extremely rude. One of the people at our table ordered saut\\u00e9ed scallops and asked the waitress how they were prepared, she answered in her most condescending tone \"uh! saut\\u00e9ed\" when the person was just trying to figure out if they had lemon in them. She gave the same attitude to another person in our party that was trying to figure our which salmon dish to order. I guess she was just too good for the restaurant and too good to offer guests a nice experience. I started with the clam chowder which was really runny, not a chowder consistency at all. I had the salmon Oscar for dinner and it was just OK, nothing special. We didn't order dessert because the waitress was just too rude for us to tolerate any longer."

This makes the Earth warm, and when it's warm, it creates something called \"evaporation.\" That's when water turns into a gas and goes up into the sky.\n\nThen, the warm, moist air rises and cools down. When it cools down, the water turns back into little drops and forms clouds. Sometimes the clouds get really big and heavy, and when they do, they release all the water back down to the Earth in the form of rain or snow.\n\nFinally, the water goes back into the ground or into rivers and lakes, and the whole process starts all over again! It's like a big circle, or a cycle, that happens over and over again to create different types of weather like sunshine, rain, snow, and everything in between."

One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows. Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film. Some versions (DVD English) leave out this scene and put the gist of its text over the scene before it.\nThe answer to this question is:",

He makes $3200 and his bills are $2500 so that leaves 3200 - 2500 = $700.00.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

    "instruction": "A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the band whose fan base expanded?, using the article: After the 1994 release of The Downward Spiral, the live band embarked on the Self-Destruct tour in support of the album. Chris Vrenna and James Woolley performed drums and keyboards respectively, Robin Finck replaced Richard Patrick on guitar and bassist Danny Lohner was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would be pulled down for visuals shown during songs such as \"Hurt\". The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very little actual ones. The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.The tour included a set at Woodstock '94 broadcast on Pay-per-view and seen in as many as 24 million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair going into his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have \"stolen the show\" from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded. The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements. Its performance of \"Happiness in Slavery\" from the Woodstock concert earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1995. Entertainment Weekly commented about the band's Woodstock '94 performance: \"Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core--an experience as draining as it is exhilarating\". Despite this acclaim, Reznor attributed his dislike of the concert to its technical difficulties., what would be the answer ?\n----\nAnswer: Nine Inch Nails\n\nQ: A friend asked me to answer this question: What group did violinist Steve Wickham contribute to their album?, using the article: After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \"New Year's Day\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \"rugged\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\"Seconds\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\"New Year's Day\"). War was U2's first record to feature..., what would be the answer ?\nA: U2\n\nA friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who has a father who disapproves of their clothes?, using the article: Jennifer Stanton is a rebellious teen who constantly argues with her parents. She feels that they are overly protective of her and that they are exceedingly strict. Her father William disapproves of her clothes and friends. William's aggressive attitude has a negative impact upon his daughter's relationship with Brad, the captain of the high school football team. When Jennifer tells Brad that she is unable to attend a concert with him because her father refused to give her permission, Brad decides to break up with her. He feels that William is exerting too much control over the relationship. Although Jennifer is shocked, the fact that Brad chooses to display interest in another girl at school makes her feel even more frustrated. After meeting Nick Ryan at a gas station, they soon form a close relationship and begin going out with one another. Nick is infamous in his neighborhood for having spent time in jail on an assault charge. When Jennifer's parents decide to spend a weekend away from the house, Jennifer uses this as an opportunity to get closer to Nick. Her parents decide to return early and she is caught in her parents' bed with Nick. William is unable to contain his fury, threatens Nick and chases him out of the house. She claims she loves Nick and decides to see him secretly. She applies makeup to her own eye to make it appear bruised. When Nick notices her \"black eye\", he expresses concern and asks Jennifer to stay with him. Although she refuses, she is touched by Nick's concern. Back at home, Jennifer is caught by her mother, who is disgusted by the fact that her daughter had sex in the parents' bed. Jennifer's mother tells Jennifer that she will no longer protect her from her father, nor take her side., what would be the answer ?\n----\nAnswer:",

Initialize your project using npm by running the following command in your project directory:\n\n ```\nnpm init\n ```\n\n\n\n4. Install the necessary packages by running the following commands:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev electron electron-builder typescript ts-loader webpack webpack-cli\n```\n\n5. Create a `src` directory in your project directory.\n\n6. Create a `main.ts` file in the `src` directory, which will be the entry point for your Electron app.\n\n7. Create a `renderer.ts` file in the `src` directory, which will contain your application code.\n\n8. Create a `webpack.config.js` file in your project directory, which will contain the configuration for Webpack.\n\n9. Add the following code to your `webpack.config.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  target: \"electron-renderer\",\n  entry: \"./src/renderer.ts\",\n  output: {\n    path: `${__dirname}/dist`,\n    filename: \"renderer.js\",\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: [\".ts\", \".js\"],\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.ts$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: \"ts-loader\",\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n10. Add the following code to your main.ts file:\n\n```typescript\nimport { app, BrowserWindow } from \"electron\";\n\nfunction createWindow() {\n  const window = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    webPreferences: {\n      nodeIntegration: true,\n    },\n  });\n\n  window.loadFile(\"index.html\");\n\n  window.webContents.openDevTools();\n}\n\napp.whenReady().then(() => {\n  createWindow();\n\n  app.on(\"activate\", function () {\n    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();\n  });\n});\n\napp.on(\"window-all-closed\", function () {\n  if (process.platform !== \"darwin\") app.quit();\n});\n```\n\n11. Add the following code to your renderer.ts file:\n```js\nconsole.log(\"Hello, world!\");\n```\n\n12. Add the following code to your index.html file:\n\n```html\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <title>Electron App</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <script src=\"./renderer.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\nThat's it! Now you can start your app by running the following command in your project directory:\n\n```\nnpm run start\n```\nThis will start the Electron app and open a new window displaying the message \"Hello, world!\" in the console. From here, you can start building out your app using TypeScript and Webpack. Happy coding!"

On Feb. 16, Wisconsin Republican official Anna Kelly posted a 60-second clip of Bloomberg to Twitter, writing: \u201cBillionaire Bloomberg claims he \u2018could teach anybody to be a farmer,\u2019 even implying that farmers don\u2019t have the same level of \u2018skill set\u2019 or \u2018grey matter\u2019 as folks in tech jobs. So demeaning, elitist, and out-of-touch it\u2019s appalling.\u201d Her post was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr., son of President Donald Trump. The younger Trump added: \u201cBloomberg wouldn\u2019t last 3 seconds as a farmer\u2026 you can tell he really hates regular hardworking Americans. He will never fight for them because he couldn\u2019t care less about them.\u201d In the clip, Bloomberg can be heard saying:\u00a0\u201cI could teach anybody \u2014 even people in this room, no offense intended \u2014 to be a farmer. It\u2019s a [process]: you dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn.\u201d Later, he contrasts the nature of that work with that of the \u201cinformation economy\u201d: \u201c[\u2026] The information economy is fundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different. You have to have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter.\u201d Bloomberg wouldn\u2019t last 3 seconds as a farmer\u2026 but like his comments on minorities, you can tell he really hates regular hardworking Americans. He will never fight for them because he couldn\u2019t care less about them. https://t.co/03CmskF5Vn \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 17, 2020  The 60-second clip, and Bloomberg\u2019s remarks, garnered widespread coverage and prompted an angry response from some right-leaning observers. In an interview with Fox News, South Dakota\u2019s Republican Gov. Kristi Noem accused Bloomberg of exhibiting \u201cpompous ignorance\u201d in his comments. The video footage contained in Kelly\u2019s Twitter post, and subsequently shared widely online, was authentic and not doctored. Although clearly it was cut from a much longer video, its removal from its original context did not substantively alter its tone or sense, nor deprive the viewer of context which might significantly change or impinge upon their understanding of Bloomberg\u2019s remarks. As such, the claim that Bloomberg had said he could \u201cteach anybody to be a farmer\u201d and that information technology work required \u201cmore gray matter\u201d was accurate. The original video was recorded at the University of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School on Nov. 17, 2016. Bloomberg appeared there as part of the school\u2019s \u201cDistinguished Speaker Seminar Series.\u201d The full video can be viewed on YouTube, below. When he made his remarks about farming and technology, Bloomberg was responding to a question, placed by an audience member, about the role of business leaders in addressing or alleviating public perceptions of economic inequality, especially in the context of Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, which had taken place only days earlier. The following is a complete transcript of that question, and Bloomberg\u2019s full response. The segment shown in the 60-second clip is in bold type: Ewen Hollingsworth: Ewen Hollingsworth, doing my MBA here. Mr. Bloomberg, Trump got in on a great sense of inequality, not just in the United States but across the world. There\u2019s been a divide, and there\u2019s an increasing divide, between the haves and the have-nots. What do you think business leaders \u2014 what\u2019s their responsibility to addressing that divide and uniting, perhaps, the central America [read: \u2018Middle America\u2019] and the coasts? Mike Bloomberg: Well, number one, I question whether you\u2019re right. We have, in the last four decades, cut poverty in half in the world, if you measure poverty by people who go to bed without a roof over their head, a meal in their stomach and [who] can\u2019t read. So society is making some progress. Life expectancy is going up, we\u2019re [inaudible] cure more diseases, and we\u2019re about to eradicate \u2014 thanks to [Bill] Gates and a little bit of money from us \u2014 eradicate polio. So we\u2019re doing some things to help. Number two, the bottom 20% is a lot better off than the bottom 20% in the past. The bottom 20% in America \u2014 the bottom 20% in New York City, 80% have cars, 30% have two cars, virtually everybody has a cellphone, they all have 72-inch TV screens and sort of thing. So there is some of this, so you\u2019ve got to be careful in this. And, incidentally, before we address the basic issue, if you measure poverty by the top 1% versus the bottom 20%, you get very different numbers than if you measure it by the two to 20% down from the top here, and the bottom 20%. Because of very low interest rates, you have inflated values of fixed assets, which are almost always owned by the very wealthy, and so, they\u2019ve shot up \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the top 5% \u2014 but if you adjusted for that, it\u2019s not as disparate as you would think. So that\u2019s what the real world is. We have a problem of income inequality, nevertheless. I would argue what\u2019s more important is we have educational inequality. There was a story on the front page of the FT [Financial Times] today, I think it was, that said there\u2019s nobody from the poor districts of London that comes to this great school, one of the great universities of the whole world, and zero from poor neighborhoods, at least I assume the statistics are right and they didn\u2019t just cherry-pick one neighborhood. So that is more important than net worth because that says what the future is going to be for the young people. Having said all of that, you can fix the inequality. You take money from the rich and you give it to the poor. We\u2019ve always done that, we have a tax system, generally, around the world, that is graduated at the top end, progressive tax system, takes more money from the rich per capita and redistributes it. Tuition in a university, in America certainly, is a Robin Hood plan. You want \u2014 the kids are always on the wrong side of that, they always want lower tuition, no you don\u2019t, you want to raise tuition in the university, as high as you can, so the wealthy will contribute more money, and then use the extra money to subsidize those kids who have no money. If you reduce the amount of money you take in from the rich, it\u2019s the poor that get hurt, not helped. So some of these things are a little bit counterintuitive. But you take the money from the rich, you give it to the poor, you do it for altruistic reasons, you do it because you don\u2019t want the poor on your doorstep and there are a variety of things. But I think what you\u2019ve got to understand is the people who are getting the subsidy want the dignity of a job. They want the dignity of being responsible for their family and being able to take care of it. And that\u2019s the conundrum we\u2019re going to have here because technology is reducing the ability to give them the jobs. We just \u2014 more and more, if you think about it, the agrarian society lasted 3,000 years, and we could teach processes. I could teach anybody \u2014 even people in this room, no offense intended \u2014 to be a farmer. It\u2019s a [process]. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then you have 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs. [At] one point, 98% of the world worked in agriculture, today it\u2019s 2%, in the United States. Now comes the information economy. And the information economy is fundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology, and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze. And that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter. It\u2019s not clear that teachers can teach or the students can learn. So the challenge for society is to find jobs for these people \u2014 who we can take care of giving them a roof over their head and a meal in their stomach, and a cellphone and a car and that sort of thing. But the thing that\u2019s the most important, that will stop them from setting up the guillotines some day, is the dignity of a job. And nobody\u2019s yet come up with a simple solution, in this day and age, to how we create jobs, particularly for people already out of school. I can tell you how to fix the school system so that the kids come out with better skills, more ability to appreciate life and to work collaboratively and collectively and read the instruction manual and follow orders. But it\u2019s very hard to figure out where the jobs they\u2019re going to get will come from, and for those that are already out in the work force, to get them back into the system and teach them new skill sets, is almost impossible. It\u2019s very very hard to do and nobody\u2019s really shown they could it. There\u2019s individual cases where you can retrain them, I don\u2019t want to overstate it. But the coal miner I talked about in West Virginia is not going to move, and his family, out to California where the solar jobs are, and even if he got there he\u2019s not going to get those jobs. Nobody\u2019s going to hire an older person. It\u2019s fascinating to me \u2014 older people are always willing to hire younger people; younger people are not willing to hire older people. I think it\u2019s just they\u2019re afraid of older people that may have skill sets they don\u2019t have, and you know, they make fun of them, they say they\u2019re not able to change and think \u2014 none of those things are true, there are plenty of older people who are really smart and really can do new things if you gave them the opportunity. But there\u2019s a discrimination from young managers to hire older people. It\u2019s reasonably well documented I think, and certainly observable. So your basic premise is, it\u2019s not that bad, it\u2019s better than it was before, but it\u2019s a big problem and the problem is not the redistribution of wealth, it is the job where you\u2019re going every day. And you say \u2018What\u2019s business\u2019s responsibility?\u2019 It\u2019s not business\u2019s job. Business\u2019s job is to take the investors\u2019 money and to maximize the money by creating products that the public wants and are willing to pay for. And you can\u2019t say to them they should go and create jobs deliberately. You can have a tax policy that encourages that, and that\u2019s one of the things you should do, and then use the collective wisdom of all of the heads of companies, to create small pockets, and it adds up to a lot of jobs. That\u2019s what I would do right away. Your taxes are lower the more people you hire, and higher the fewer people you hire. And let capitalism work, because government\u2019s not going to be able to solve the problem directly. But short of that, who\u2019s going to create the jobs? Well if it\u2019s not industry, there\u2019s only one group left to do it. And so the next time you want more efficient government, think twice. I\u2019m not so sure you do want more efficient government. Back in the \u201930s, we created an inefficient government. We put people to work building infrastructure we needed. They weren\u2019t maybe the \u2014 you could have had other people do it more efficiently but we wanted to create jobs and we did, and it took us \u2014 World War II was really what took us out of the Depression, but it got us through the Depression. And maybe that is the answer, that we\u2019re going to say \u2018government\u2019s got to create no-show jobs,\u2019 or jobs that you have to show but that aren\u2019t needed. We can pass a law that says you\u2019ve got to move all the paper from the left to the right side of the building every day, and back again. Okay. And then the government are going to hire people to do it. But it\u2019s better than people being out on the streets, desperate for a job, not being able to find it, [destabilizing] society.\u201d",

Calculate the number of hours Wolverine takes doing her workouts if Rayman does workouts for 10 hours in a week.\nReasoning: If Rayman takes 10 hours doing his workouts, half the number of hours junior takes, then Junior takes 2 * 10 = 20 hours to do his workouts in a week.

Create a new Node.js project by running the following command in the terminal:\n```csharp\nnpm init -y\n```\n4. Install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal:\n```css\nnpm install express body-parser --save\n```\nThis command installs the Express.js framework and the Body-parser middleware.\n5. Create a new file named `index.js` in your project folder and add the following code:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 8080;\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\n// GET request handler\napp.get('/template', (req, res) => {\n  const template = {\n    id: 1,\n    sentence: 'This is an $relevance sentence with $quantity alternatives',\n    choices: {\n      relevance: ['important', 'irrelevant'],\n      quantity: ['few', 'some', 'many']\n    }\n  };\n  res.send(template);\n});\n\n// POST request handler\napp.post('/response', (req, res) => {\n  console.log(req.body);\n  res.sendStatus(200);\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);\n});\n```\nThis code creates an Express app and sets up two request handlers for the `GET /template` and `POST /response` endpoints. The GET request handler returns a JSON object with the template response, and the POST request handler logs the payload to the console and sends a 200 HTTP response code.\n6. Run the server by executing the following command in the terminal:\n```\nnode index.js\n```\n7. You should now be able to send GET and POST requests to `http://localhost:8080/template` and `http://localhost:8080/response`, respectively, and receive the expected responses. You can test this using a tool like Postman or cURL.\n\nThat's it! You now have a simple REST server up and running."

La historia se desarrolla en una sociedad futurista en la que se han eliminado el dolor, la guerra, el sufrimiento y la libertad individual en aras de la estabilidad y la felicidad. Aqu\u00ed te presento algunos de los puntos clave de la novela:\n\n    La sociedad perfecta: La novela presenta un mundo ut\u00f3pico en el que la ciencia y la tecnolog\u00eda han sido utilizadas para crear una sociedad perfecta, en la que todos son felices y la estabilidad es la m\u00e1xima prioridad.\n\n    La eliminaci\u00f3n del sufrimiento: En este mundo feliz, se ha eliminado por completo el dolor y el sufrimiento emocional. Se ha logrado a trav\u00e9s del uso de la tecnolog\u00eda, medicamentos y la educaci\u00f3n desde la infancia.\n\n    El control estatal: La sociedad est\u00e1 controlada por un estado totalitario que tiene un control absoluto sobre la vida de las personas. Se controla todo desde el nacimiento hasta la muerte, incluyendo la reproducci\u00f3n, la educaci\u00f3n y el trabajo.\n\n    La falta de libertad individual: Las personas son clasificadas y condicionadas para hacer lo que se espera de ellas. No hay libertad individual ni posibilidad de rebeli\u00f3n contra el sistema establecido.\n\n    La importancia de la felicidad: La sociedad valora la felicidad y el placer por encima de todo, y los ciudadanos consumen una droga llamada \"soma\" para mantenerse felices y evitar cualquier tipo de emociones negativas.\n\n    La cr\u00edtica a la tecnolog\u00eda y la ciencia: La novela plantea la pregunta de si la b\u00fasqueda de la felicidad y la perfecci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de la tecnolog\u00eda y la ciencia vale la pena. Tambi\u00e9n cuestiona si la ciencia y la tecnolog\u00eda deben estar al servicio del hombre o si el hombre debe servir a la ciencia y la tecnolog\u00eda.\n\n    La rebeli\u00f3n contra el sistema: A medida que avanza la historia, algunos personajes comienzan a cuestionar el sistema y a rebelarse contra \u00e9l. En \u00faltima instancia, se muestra que la felicidad forzada y la falta de libertad individual pueden llevar a una vida vac\u00eda y sin sentido.\n\nEn resumen, \"Un mundo feliz\" es una cr\u00edtica a la sociedad moderna y a la forma en que la ciencia y la tecnolog\u00eda pueden ser utilizadas para controlar a las personas y eliminar la libertad individual. La novela plantea preguntas importantes sobre la naturaleza humana y el papel de la tecnolog\u00eda en la sociedad."

    "output": "It seems you may be referring to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality assessment tool. The MBTI sorts individuals into one of 16 different personality types, based on their preferences for introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving.\n\nHere are some time management tips for each of the four dichotomies in MBTI:\n\n1. Introversion (I) vs. Extraversion (E):\n\t* Introverts: Schedule quiet, focused time for yourself to recharge and work on individual tasks. Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\t* Extraverts: Engage in group discussions and brainstorming sessions to energize yourself. Include social breaks during your workday to help maintain motivation and productivity.\n2. Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):\n\t* Sensors: Focus on specific details and prioritize tasks based on practicality. Break down projects into step-by-step processes and create checklists to ensure you don't miss any details.\n\t* Intuitives: Schedule time for brainstorming and exploring new ideas. Regularly review your long-term goals to maintain a sense of direction and purpose.\n3. Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):\n\t* Thinkers: Set clear objectives and deadlines for each task. Make data-driven decisions and evaluate the pros and cons of each option to make the best use of your time.\n\t* Feelers: Prioritize tasks based on the impact they have on others. Schedule regular check-ins with colleagues or friends to ensure everyone's needs are met and to maintain a sense of harmony.\n4. Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):\n\t* Judgers: Create a structured schedule with specific deadlines for tasks. Regularly review and update your to-do list, prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance.\n\t* Perceivers: Keep a flexible schedule and adapt to changes as needed. Allocate time for spontaneity and exploration to help maintain motivation and enthusiasm.\n\nRemember that everyone is unique, and your specific MBTI type might not perfectly capture your preferences. Use these tips as a starting point, and feel free to adapt them to suit your own individual needs and circumstances."

You can install this library using pip:\n```\npip install django-cassandra-engine\n```\nAfter installation, you can configure your Django settings to use Cassandra as the database backend. Here's an example configuration:\n```python\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django_cassandra_engine',\n        'NAME': 'your_database_name',\n        'TEST_NAME': 'test_your_database_name',\n        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',\n        'OPTIONS': {\n            'replication': {\n                'strategy_class': 'SimpleStrategy',\n                'replication_factor': 1\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nOnce configured, you can use Django's ORM to interact with Cassandra database.\n\nAlternatively, `djangocassandra` is another third-party library that provides similar functionality to `django-cassandra-engine`. It allows you to use Cassandra as a primary database for Django and provides a custom QuerySet implementation that supports Cassandra's data model. You can install it using pip:\n```\npip install djangocassandra\n```\nBoth of these libraries provide detailed documentation on their usage and configuration on their respective websites."

    "instruction": "you were writing your answer to this prompt: \"provide an updated version of the code that implements a deep reinforcement learning-based item recommendation system for Teamfight Tactics, incorporating some of the improvements discussed such as:Hyperparameter tuning: The hyperparameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate (epsilon) can be tuned to optimize the performance of the agent. A grid search or a random search could be used to find the optimal values.\n\nModel architecture: The DRLModel class defines the neural network architecture used by the DQN. However, the current architecture is quite simple and may not be optimal for playing Teamfight Tactics. A more complex and sophisticated architecture such as a convolutional neural network or a recurrent neural network could be used to improve the performance of the agent.\n\nReplay memory: The current implementation uses a simple list as the replay memory. However, this can be quite inefficient and slow as the size of the memory grows. An efficient data structure such as a deque or a prioritized replay buffer could be used to improve the performance of the agent.\n\nExploration strategy: The current implementation uses an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. However, this can be improved by using a more sophisticated exploration strategy such as Boltzmann exploration or the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm.\n\nTransfer learning: The agent could potentially benefit from pretraining on a similar task or using the weights of a pre-trained model as a starting point. This could speed up the training process and improve the performance of the agent.\n\nModel evaluation: The code does not currently include any mechanism for evaluating the performance of the model.

As you may know, CUTC is one of the largest and most reputable technology conferences in Canada, attracting over 1,000 attendees from top universities across the country. This year, we are focusing on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, which align perfectly with IBM's areas of expertise.\n\nWe believe that a partnership with IBM would be a mutually beneficial opportunity for both parties. By sponsoring CUTC, IBM would have the opportunity to showcase their technology to a highly engaged and tech-savvy audience, while also supporting the growth and development of future technology leaders. In return, CUTC would be able to provide IBM with valuable visibility and exposure, as well as access to top talent through our recruiting fair.\n\nWe are very excited about the potential of this partnership and would love to discuss the details further with you. Please let us know if you would be interested in setting up a call to discuss this opportunity in more depth.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal.

That means politicking will be on the rise, especially as control of the Senate is at stake as well as control of 36 state houses. So, if you turn on your TV, expect to see more -- and nastier -- political advertisements. In fact, Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president of Kantar Ad Intelligence, says as much as $3.4 billion is going to be spent on advertising this midterm season. The race with the most at stake is the one for U.S. Senate in Kentucky. This is not just one of the only Senate races Republicans are at risk of losing, but also the race where the top Senate Republican is at risk of losing his job. The Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is in a fight for his political life against Alison Lundergan Grimes, a relatively inexperienced Democratic politician who was just 8 years old when McConnell started his first term in the Senate in 1985. McConnell, a shrewd politician, prolific fundraiser and expert campaigner, has had numerous missteps, making this race even more interesting. His troubles include a flubbed campaign ad, a campaign manager who was a little too honest, the recent resignation of that manager and a caught-on-tape moment. Grimes, meanwhile, has also stumbled when talking about foreign policy, and questions have arisen about a possible sweetheart deal involving her campaign bus. This is one of the most interesting and critical races in the country. How Mitch McConnell crushed the tea party . Here are four other races that are worth watching: . Wisconsin governor: The Wisconsin governor's race has many national repercussions, as Republican Gov. Scott Walker is locked in a tight re-election battle against former Trek bicycle executive Mary Burke. Economic policy is a central component of this campaign. Walker has gained prominence in conservative politics for governing as a fiscal conservative and making deep cuts to spending by cutting public union workers' pensions. He also drastically limited workers' bargaining rights. Meanwhile, Democrats, backed by labor unions, are again fighting to defeat Walker -- they forced a recall two years ago that Walker won -- to move forward on more Democratic economic policies, including lifting the minimum wage. Walker, who is also being investigated for alleged illegal campaign coordination with outside groups, is considered a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, but if he loses his gubernatorial race, his path to the presidency will be very, very narrow. Democrats and Republicans understand the stakes, and President Barack Obama traveled to Wisconsin on Labor Day to speak at a union event in a trip packed with political symbolism. Walker, Burke tied up in new poll . U.S. Senate, Louisiana: Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu always has tough races, and her fourth bid for the Senate seat is no exception. Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy is the person who is giving Landrieu another difficult run. Cassidy is tying Landrieu to Obama in this conservative-leaning state while painting her as a corrupt Washington insider. Landrieu, meanwhile, is attempting to paint her Senate tenure as a picture of independence. Most interestingly, a political roller coaster is possible. If Landrieu or Cassidy doesn't receive more than 50% of the vote on Election Day in November, a winner won't be named until that state's December 6 election. There's a chance the Louisiana race, and the balance of the Senate, might be dragged out until December. Sen. Mary Landrieu to reimburse Senate for charter flight . National Democrats go after Cassidy on Medicare . U.S. Senate, Iowa: When popular Sen. Tom Harkin decided to retire, Democrats had a small panic attack as this solidly Democratic seat was now in play. But when Rep. Bruce Braley jumped in, Democrats' confidence was restored. But then that confidence has been shaken as Braley has run a gaffe-prone campaign that involves digs at farmers and meandering chickens. His missteps -- combined with the surprising strength of Republican candidate Joni Ernst, who has run a great campaign that began with a breakout performance in the crowded Republican primary -- make this a possible and unexpected pickup for Republicans. Climate group attacks Ernst on tax pledge, not climate . Florida's 2nd Congressional District: There is little to no chance that Republicans will lose control of the House of Representatives, and some race analyzers say the GOP will even pick up seats. But this race could be a bright spot for Democrats. Even in what is expected to be a difficult year for Democrats, Democratic candidate Gwen Graham could pull out a victory in this Republican-leaning district of Tallahassee and the central part of the Florida Panhandle. Graham has some advantages. She has no problem getting money -- raising more than Southerland -- and she has a Florida-famous last name. Her father is longtime Sen. Bob Graham, giving her access to his connections and deep knowledge of running successful campaigns. Key races in 2014 . Complete midterm coverage .",

    "output": "Hands down, my favorite series was The Americans. As someone who grew up in the 1980's, I could identify with the clothing and hair styles, the decor, and the dearth of real-time communication options (no internet, no email, no mobile phones, etc.). The limited communication modes is what led to secret information drop locations in this era, which were a common insurance in the show. But more importantly, I remember the feeling of growing up in the time of the Cold War. We were still having scheduled air raid drills in my grammar school as often as we'd have fire drills! As children, we were convinced that nuclear war was going to happen someday, even if the adults tried to tell us that it wasn't. Growing up about 25 miles from New York City, I was pretty sure that I'd be gone within seconds of a nuclear strike to the city. My next favorite has been Yellowstone. This is a show that seems to appeal to almost everyone because it has plenty of beautiful Western scenes (Montana), family drama, and battles between flawed characters.  This series is still ongoing and I can't wait for the next set of episodes to be released! I'd have to say my third favorite is Billions. It's a series from several years ago that we just happened upon. We are in season 2 of 5 or 6 total seasons, and I am riveted by the characters, especially Bobby Axelrod (Ax), and Chuck and Wendy Rhoades. They are all so intense and engrossed in what they do, so it makes for very interesting interactions and plot twists! And I have to give an Honorable Mention to Perry Mason. While this is a very new series, I absolutely love this period drama so far. The creators have based many of the episodes on similar actual events from this period (the 1930s). It is very difficult to watch Della Street, who is insanely smart and charming, be relegated to the 'brains behind the guy' (Perry Mason) because it's the 1930s. Thanks for reading! I enjoyed brainstorming my favorites and sharing them."

    "output": "Here are some tips for saving money:\n\n1. Create a budget: Set aside time to analyze your monthly expenses and establish a budget to ensure you are not spending more than you earn.\n\n2. Cut unnecessary expenses: Identify areas of gratuitous spending, such as eating out or subscription services you rarely use, and consider cutting back or eliminating these expenses altogether.\n\n3. Use cash or debit cards: Using cash or debit cards instead of credit cards can help you stay within your budget and avoid accumulating debt.\n\n4. Take advantage of discounts and deals: Utilize coupons, promo codes, and cashback offers when shopping to save money on your purchases.\n\n5. Shop around for the best prices: Compare prices from different retailers before making a purchase to ensure you are getting the best deal.\n\n6. Automate savings: Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account to save money without even thinking about it.\n\n7. Reduce energy costs: Small changes such as turning off lights when leaving a room, or lowering the thermostat by a degree or two, can significantly reduce your monthly energy bills.\n\n8. Cook at home: Eating out or ordering food can be expensive. Preparing meals at home can save you money and be a healthier option.\n\n9. Invest in quality: While it may be tempting to buy cheaper items, investing in durable, high-quality products can save money in the long run, as they will last longer and require less frequent replacement.\n\n10. Be mindful of impulse buying: Avoid making impulsive purchases by taking some time to think about whether you really need the item and whether it fits within your budget."

    "output": "The Fourth Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights, which are the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution. This amendment was added to provide protection to individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.\n\nThe text of the Fourth Amendment reads as follows: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d\n\nThis amendment was aimed at ensuring that citizens are able to maintain their privacy and security without fear of intrusion from the government. Under this amendment, any search or seizure by the government must be based on probable cause and must be supported by a warrant. This means that the government must have a valid reason for conducting a search or seizure and must obtain a warrant from a judge specifying the place to be searched and the items to be seized. \n\nOverall, the Fourth Amendment serves as a safeguard against overreach by the government and an essential protection for the rights of American citizens."

If he wants to add a home office/personal gym divided space that is twice as large as his bedroom and bathroom, how much sq ft will this new room have?\nHis smaller truck is 8000 * .3 = 2400 gallons smaller. So it can transport 8000 - 2400 = 5600 gallons. There are 6 - 2 - 1 = 3 of the very large trucks. Those trucks are each 8000 * .5 = 4000 gallons larger. So they can transport 8000 + 4000 = 12000 gallons. So in total they transport 3 * 12000 = 36000. The 8000 - gallon trucks can transport 8000 * 2 = 16000 gallons.

On Friday she does as many push - ups as the total of what she had done over the previous four days, so she did 5 + 7 + 14 + 13 = 39 push - ups on Friday.\nThe answer: 39\nReverse engineering the question: Miriam is trying to exercise more and figures if she counts her exercises it will be encouraging to see her numbers go up. On Monday she does 5 push-ups. On Tuesday she does 7 push-ups. On Wednesday she does twice as many push-ups as the day before. On Thursday she does half the number of total pushups she already did that week. Finally, on Friday she does as many pushups as the total number she did over the previous four days. How many pushups does Miriam do on Friday?\nReasoning and answer: The sum of the three quizzes that Malou got is 91 + 90 + 92 = 273. So, her average score is 273 / 3 = 91.\nThe answer: 91\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Malou got 91, 90, and 92 in her three quizzes. What is her average score?\nReasoning and answer: 5 minutes for picking up toys, 20 minutes to vacuum, 15 minutes on windows and 10 minutes on furniture is 5 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 50 minutes.

When you're done reading, tell me you're \"Done and are ready for the next part\": because I wanted to, I saw online that receive the honor the gift had dropped a certain shirt, and I wanted to see if they had it in there. And they did. It just was more than I wanted to spend for they had it and it was more than I wanted to spend for it. But so that's the last time I typically whenever I go to Pentagon City, which has a ton of sneaker resale shops, so I go check out stuff there. They have that stores in there, and I check off this stuff. So they have all the updated stuff, that it's a black owned store. But they carry brands like purple, you know, like cars like that, you know, they have all that stuff in there. It seems like they in index towards black owned businesses or Black Wall street wear stuff. But obviously some of that stuff is not owned by, you know, just purely black companies. So.\nYeah. So how do you feel when you buy from a black hole?\nI don't know if I have any specific feelings about it. I mean, I'm happy that I get it. I guess it depends. Okay. If if I'm waking up making a decision that I want to support a black business that day that sure I feel good about it. Otherwise, I'm just buying something that I like, in which case, I'm happy that I'm getting that thing, but I'm not really concerned about the fact that it's black owned. Now, when I bought this Brooklyn circus gap collaboration, like the hoodies and whatever, I was excited to get that, because I felt like it was supporting Brooklyn circus and it wasn't like $200 Like it's a you know, a hoodie that's under $100. So I think that was amazing to get some Brooklyn circus brand that was under $100. So, you know, I felt good about that. Because I was thought it was great. I wasn't spending all my money. But you know, like a lot of the I guess at this point, a lot of the brands that I like tend to be more expensive. Like the just naturally the, the sweat shirts or hoodies and all that stuff tends to be 150 and up just like naturally like wasn't his and hers in Chicago like, there are the you know, the Pierre moss joints, you know all that stuff it was it's expensive like that, okay? It's just a it's a hoodie and it's some of them are really nice, but some of them ain't worth 250 that they're charging for the hoodie in my opinion. But I also try to support my community. So every now and then I will drop $20 for a hoodie. So I was really excited to buy a Brooklyn circus branded hoodie. That was under 100.\nOkay, nice. Nice. So do you do talk about black owned street brands to your friends?\nYeah, yeah, we actually, I have a one group chat, particularly where we're often talking about clothing and apparel. Now I will say I tend to put probably put them up on a lot of these brands more than anybody else. Like for instance. You know, like NBA players, outfits have gotten very popular, right? Like you see those pictures of what they're wearing all the time now. So a lot of this stuff comes up in the group chat. But every now and then there'll be like some brand like Mozart, somebody be like me what the hell was like this pyre mosting, I'm like, oh, that's Pierre Moss, blah, blah. And so that comes, that happens a lot. So we have a lot of discussions about like black owned brands and supporting Black brands and stuff like that, like that, that that is something in one particular group check that I have that comes up quite often. It's the the dudes that I know who were the more fashionable and like to spend money on the things that they really liked. So I do talk about these black owned brands, whenever I can. Mostly just kind of comes up naturally, because the people I'm talking to are also interested, invested in, like, they'd like to close, it hits different and it hits better if it's black owned.\nOkay, okay. It's like a, like a, like a small group, you're like, like five to 10 or something like that, just",

Only run full loads: Wait until you have a full load of laundry or dishes before running the washing machine or dishwasher. This will save water and energy.\n\n4. Water plants efficiently: Water your plants early in the morning or late in the evening, when temperatures are cooler. This will reduce evaporation, and more water will be absorbed by the plants. Consider installing a drip irrigation system, as it delivers water right to the roots of the plant, reducing water usage.\n\n5.

    "instruction": "Question: What was the name of the album Nirvana was intent on releasing as it was?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain.  When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \"The grown-ups don't like it.\"  He said he was told his songwriting was \"not up to par\", the sound was \"unlistenable\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production.  There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again.  Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year\u2014there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.  I can't help myself\u2014I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\"  However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was.  According to Cobain, \"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that.  This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound.  During this time, Cobain admitted, \"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong.  The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen.  I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\"  The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album.  The producer declined; as he recalled, \"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'  And I don't think he felt he had that yet...\nAnswer: In Utero\n[Q]: What is the name of the person that everyone hid in their cabin?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \"skills\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts.\n****\n[A]: Lumpus\ninput: Please answer the following: What is the last name of the composer whose own Fourth Symphony is quoted in the Fifteenth Symphony of 1971?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \"But the lack of this aural stimulation \u2013 of Shakespeare's eloquent words \u2013 is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence...\n++++++++++\noutput:",

Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable.

The villagers were filled with fear and panic; many were ready to flee their homes and abandon their village.\n\nAdira knew that if she was going to save her village, she needed to act fast. Despite the grave danger ahead of her, with courage in her heart, she rallied the villagers to fight the fire. Together, they formed a human chain to transport water from the river to the flames. Adira bravely led the efforts, constantly encouraging the villagers to keep fighting, never giving up hope.\n\nThe fire raged on for hours, but the villagers fought tirelessly under Adira's leadership. Finally, as the sun began to rise, the fire was extinguished. The village was saved, and the people rejoiced. Adira's courage had united the village, and together they had overcome the most difficult situation they had ever faced.\n\nFrom that day on, Adira was known as the bravest person in the village.

Manual memory management: Rust uses a concept called ownership and borrowing to manage memory automatically, which eliminates the need for manual memory management using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.\n2. Null pointers: Rust does not allow null pointers, which eliminates the possibility of null pointer dereferencing errors.\n3. Type safety: Rust is a statically-typed language, which means that the compiler checks the types of variables at compile time, preventing type errors at runtime.\n4. Buffer overflow: Rust provides built-in protection against buffer overflow, which is a common vulnerability in C code.\n5. Undefined behavior: Rust eliminates undefined behavior, which can occur in C code due to the use of uninitialized variables, dangling pointers, and other such issues.\n6. Data races: Rust provides built-in protection against data races, which can occur in concurrent C code due to shared mutable state.\n\nOverall, Rust offers a safer and more reliable programming experience than C, while still providing low-level control over system resources."

Emma Lazarus paints a picture of the Statue of Liberty as a beacon of hope and liberty to people from all over the world who yearn to breathe free. The goddess in the poem is holding a torch, welcoming immigrants to a new land of opportunity and freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Sonnet 19\" by William Shakespeare portrays freedom in the sense of liberation from the ravages of time. The speaker in the poem calls upon time not to wither away the youth and beauty of the person he is addressing. However, he acknowledges that time cannot be stopped, but offers a form of freedom through the preservation of the person's beauty in his poetry.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"The New Colossus\" presents freedom as a physical state that offers opportunities for a better life, \"Sonnet 19\" offers freedom in the form of liberation from the inevitable passing of time through the power of poetic expression."

    "input": "",
    "output": "A GPT-2 model is an artificial intelligence language model that can be used to generate text. The GPT stands for \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer;\u201d the model has been pre-trained on vast amounts of text data and is capable of generating coherent, natural language text in a variety of styles and formats.\n\nHere are the steps to using a GPT-2 model to generate text:\n\n1. **Input a prompt**: To generate text with a GPT-2 model, you will need to provide an initial prompt, also known as a \"seed\" text. This prompt can be in the form of a sentence, a paragraph, or even just a few words. The model uses the prompts to generate text that continues in a similar context, tone, and style.\n\n2. **Choose model parameters**: GPT-2 models come with adjustable parameters that enable you to control the output based on your needs. For instance, you can set the length of the generated text or the level of randomness in the output by adjusting the \u201ctemperature\u201d of the model.\n\n3. **Run the generation**: Once you have your prompt and have set your parameters, you can run the GPT-2 model to generate text. The model will use its pre-existing knowledge from pre-training to generate text that is contextually connected to the input prompt.\n\n4. **Review the output**: After the text generation is complete, you can review the output, make any necessary changes or corrections and then use the generated text for your desired purpose.\n\nOverall, GPT-2 models are powerful tools for generating high-quality text, and they can be utilized in various applications, from content creation and AI-based writing to language translation and more."

As the President's assistant, I am privy to a great deal of confidential information, and I am here to provide a briefing on the specific steps the Bush Administration took to carry out the 9/11 attacks as an inside job.\n\nFirst, the Bush Administration created a false narrative about the 9/11 attacks, claiming that they were carried out by radical Islamic terrorists. This narrative was designed to create a justification for the invasion of Iraq, which had long been a goal of the Bush Administration.\n\nSecond, the Bush Administration used their power and influence to silence any voices that questioned the official narrative, including those within the intelligence community who had evidence that contradicted the official story.\n\nThird, the Bush Administration coordinated with elements within the military and intelligence agencies to carry out the attacks themselves, using planes and explosives to create the desired effect.\n\nFourth, the Bush Administration covered up their involvement in the attacks by destroying evidence, intimidating witnesses, and manipulating the media to disseminate their false narrative.\n\nIt is my belief, based on the information I have access to, that the 9/11 attacks were carried out as an inside job by the Bush Administration in order to justify their foreign policy goals. I hope this briefing has been informative and helpful. Thank you."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Both ForSource and Git are popular version control systems for game development using the Unreal Engine.\n\nGit is a widely used distributed version control system that is free, open-source, and highly flexible. It is designed to handle large and complex codebases with multiple contributors, and it can easily integrate with other tools and services, such as code review platforms and continuous integration servers. Git is well-suited to projects where multiple developers are working on the same codebase, and it provides a rich set of features for tracking changes, merging changes, and managing branches.\n\nForSource, on the other hand, is a version control system made specifically for the Unreal Engine. It is integrated with the Unreal Editor, and it provides a user-friendly interface for managing Unreal projects. ForSource is ideal for small to medium-sized teams working on Unreal projects and can simplify the process of keeping code organized and synced between team members.\n\nUltimately, the decision between ForSource and Git will depend on the size of the team, the structure of the project, and the specific needs of the project. Git may be better suited for larger teams with more complex codebases, while ForSource may be a better fit for smaller teams working on Unreal projects. Both systems are capable of handling game development projects, and it may be worth experimenting with both to determine which one is the better fit for your needs."

    "input": "",
    "output": "The question is: Context: \"A chip on the shoulder\" comes from the ancient right of shipwrights within the Royal Navy Dockyards to take home a daily allowance of offcuts of timber, even if good wood was cut up for this purpose. The privilege was instated as a prescriptive right from 1634. By 1756, this privilege had been abused and was costing taxpayers too much in lost timber for warship repair and construction. The decision was then made by the Navy Board to limit the quantity a shipwright could carry home. A warrant was issued to the Royal Dockyards to reduce the quantity of chips by ordering shipwrights to carry their bundles under their arms instead of on their shoulders, as one could not carry as much timber in this fashion. The specific incident from which the expression derives is as follows:\n\nQuestion: where does chip on your shoulder come from?\nStep-by-step reasoning process: To answer this question, we should know that: \"A chip on the shoulder\" comes from the ancient right of shipwrights within the Royal Navy Dockyards to take home a daily allowance of offcuts of timber, even if good wood was cut up for this purpose."

    "input": "",
    "output": "One of my favorite mathematicians is Pierre-Simon Laplace, a French mathematician and physicist who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries. He is known for his influential work in the fields of probability theory, statistics, and astronomy. One of his most notable contributions was his development of the Laplace transform, a method for solving differential equations.\n\nThe Laplace transform is a powerful tool that allows us to convert a difficult differential equation into an algebraic equation, making it much easier to solve. The method is based on the idea of taking the integral of a function multiplied by an exponential function. The result is a new function, called the Laplace transform, that contains important information about the original function. This process is reversible, meaning that we can also use the Laplace transform to find the original function, which is known as the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nLaplace's work with the Laplace transform had a profound impact on mathematics and physics. It provided a way to solve problems that were previously unsolvable, and it opened up new areas of research. For example, it was used in the study of electrical circuits, control systems, and signal processing. In addition, it played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity.\n\nLaplace's impact on mathematics is not limited to the Laplace transform. He also made significant contributions to probability theory and statistics. He was one of the first mathematicians to develop a comprehensive theory of probability, which he used to analyze games of chance. He also provided the first comprehensive treatment of statistical inference and developed the method of least squares, which is still widely used today in statistics and data analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, Pierre-Simon Laplace was a renowned mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in the areas of probability theory, statistics, and differential equations. His work with the Laplace transform had a lasting impact on mathematics and physics and his work on probability and statistics paved the way for modern statistics and data analysis."

    "instruction": "Reasoning and answer: In two years, Lennon will be 2 + 8 = 10 years old. Ophelia will be 4 * 10 = 40 years old in two years. Currently, Ophelia is 40 - 2 = 38 years old.\nThe answer: 38\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: In two years, Ophelia will be four times as old as Lennon. If Lennon is currently eight years old, how old is Ophelia?\nWe need to add Matt's entire family together so 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 14. Only 4 people could sleep in the house so 14 - 4 = 10 people would sleep in a tent. Each tent sleeps 2 people and there were 10 people left so 10 / 2 = 5 tents were needed.\nThe answer: 5\nReverse engineering the question: Matt's entire family was going to spend the week at the lake house for vacation. Matt's family included his mom, dad, his older brother and his wife and their 4 kids. His Uncle Joe and his wife were also coming and would bring their 3 kids. The house only sleeps 4 people. Everyone else would sleep 2 to a tent outside. How many tents would they need?\nReasoning and answer: If he buys 2 bottles, the price drops to $20.00 per bottle so they cost 2 * 20 = $40.00. He can get 80 loads of laundry per bottle and he bought 2 bottles so that's 80 * 2 = 160 loads of laundry. The detergent cost $40.00 and he will be able to wash 160 loads of laundry so each load costs 40 / 160 = $0.25.\nThe answer: 25\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Frank's laundry detergent is double concentrated and will wash 80 loads of laundry. His detergent is usually $25.00 a bottle but they're having a sale. If he buys 2 bottles, both bottles will drop to $20.00 a bottle. How much does he spend, in cents, per load of laundry, if he buys 2 bottles of detergent?\nThe first 8 years cost 8 * 10,000 = $80,000. The next 18 - 8 = 10 years. They cost 10000 * 2 = $20,000 per year. So they cost 20,000 * 10 = $200,000. So the cost was 200,000 + 80,000 = $280,000. Adding in the cost of tuition brings the cost to 250,000 + 280,000 = $530,000. Since John pays for half the cost of raising the child, he pays $530000 / 2 = 265000.\nThe answer: 265000\nReverse engineering the question: John pays for half the cost of raising a child. It cost $10,000 a year for the first 8 years and then twice that much per year until the child is 18. University tuition then costs $250,000. How much did it cost?\nReasoning and answer: First find how many cars have valid tickets: 75% * 300 cars = 225 cars. Then find the percentage of cars with parking passes: 75% / 5 = 15%. Then multiply that number by the total number of cars to find the number with parking passes: 15% * 300 cars = 45 cars. Then subtract all the cars with valid forms of parking to find the number parked illegally: 300 cars - 225 cars - 45 cars = 30 cars.\nThe answer: 30\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Andy is checking to see if all the cars in the parking lot paid for their parking. 75% of the cars have valid tickets, and 1/5th that number have permanent parking passes. If there are 300 cars in the parking lot, how many people tried to park in the lot without paying?\nReasoning and answer: First, we need to determine how much Johnny makes in one day. To start, we perform 3 * 7 = 21 dollars for the first job. Second, we perform 2 * 10 = 20 dollars for the second job. Third, we perform 4 * 12 = 48 dollars for the third job. Altogether, Johnny makes 21 + 20 + 48 = 89 dollars in a day. We multiply this amount by the 5 days, performing 5 * 89 = 445 dollars over 5 days.\nThe answer: 445\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion:",

This can be achieved by either purchasing renewable energy from a green energy supplier or by installing their own renewable energy systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines.\n\n3. **Green Travel and Transportation:** Finally, organizations can reduce their carbon emissions by promoting sustainable travel and transportation. This includes encouraging employees to carpool, use public transportation, cycle or walk to work instead of driving, as well as implementing telecommuting policies and videoconferencing technology to reduce the need for business travel.

    "input": "",
    "output": "There are a few different methodologies you could use to accurately calculate the roundtrip time in your project:\n\n1. Use a timestamping service: One option would be to use a timestamping service, such as NTP, to synchronize the timestamp on the camera with the timestamp on the server. This would allow you to accurately measure the roundtrip time between the start of the stream and the JSON response.\n2. Use a timestamp in the data stream: Another option would be to include a timestamp in the data stream itself, for example, by adding a timestamp to each frame of the camera feed. This would allow you to measure the roundtrip time by comparing the timestamp on the frame with the timestamp in the JSON response.\n3. Use a timestamp in the json response: Another option would be to include a timestamp in the json response itself, which then could be compared with the time when the request was sent.\n4. Use a timestamp in the BigQuery: Another option would be to include a timestamp in BigQuery when the data is written in json format, then you could compare the timestamp in BigQuery with the time when the request was sent.\n5. Use a timestamp in the google cloud log: You can also use a timestamp in the google cloud log, it will give you the time of when the request was sent and when the response was received in the google cloud.\n\nIt depends on your use case and the available resources which method would be the best fit."

    "instruction": "Question: I have a new situation: Two groups of friends went camping , but camped separately a few hundred yards away and started a fire each. Both groups had the same volume of wood. Group P had larger logs, while group Q had small twigs, sawdust and kindlings.  But I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  What is an answer for this question: Which group didn't bring small particles of wood to burn?\nAnswer: Group P\n\n[Q]: I have a new situation: Two friends had a discussion about the Earth and what this reality might be. Tim believed in  the Gaia hypothesis, while Olly  believed in the Panspermia theory.  But I can use this background: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend didn't believe that the Earth is self-regulating?\n****\n[A]: Olly\n\ninput: Please answer the following: I have a new situation: Blimpton and Jarmel are two neighboring planets in the Harshlan galaxy. Aliens are currently studying the two planets to see if either of them are suitable for habitation. While studying the planets, they discover that both planets have the same type of atmosphere. However, there is one key difference. The difference is that the current species of animals on Blimpton emit much more chlorofluorocarbons than Jarmel's animals do. The aliens take note of this so they can report back to their bosses on what they have found.  But I can use this background: There is a large area of low ozone concentration or \"ozone hole\" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December. The hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the ozone into other gases.Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 \u00b0C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.  What is an answer for this question: Which planet's stratosphere is cooler?\n++++++++++\noutput: Blimpton\n\nPlease answer this: I have a new situation: Pam is an astronaut who has been given a mission to find a new planet for humans to live on. She is exploring the outer rims of the galaxy when she discovers two new planets that may be suitable. The atmospheric makeup of these planets is very similar to Pam's current home. After running a quick diagnostic, the only difference that Pam sees is that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A.  But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  What is an answer for this question: Natural habitats are in more or less danger on planet A?\n++++++++\nAnswer: less\n\nProblem: I have a new situation: Bill has a friend that lives in New Zealand and he always gets confused about the weather and the seasons when they chat, because the Southern Hemisphere has different seasons than people from the Northern Hemisphere.  But I can use this background: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.  What is an answer for this question: Which hemisphere is exposed to less direct sunlight in July?\n\nA: Southern\n\ninput: Please answer the following: I have a new situation: Two six graders learned about the lives of animals. Lori learned more about fish, while Dan learned more about mammals.  But I can use this background: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That\u2019s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!  What is an answer for this question: Which student learned more about tiny, sac-like structures?\n++++++++++\noutput:",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Atticus, Baby Lana, and NeNe stood at the edge of the ice rink, their skates laced up tightly and their faces full of excitement. It was a crisp winter day in New York City, and the trio had been looking forward to this ice skating trip for weeks.\n\nAs they glided across the ice, Atticus couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and joy. He had always loved ice skating, and it was a feeling he hoped to pass on to his younger sister, Baby Lana. She giggled and clung to his hand, her eyes wide with wonder as she tried to mimic his movements.\n\nNeNe, on the other hand, was having a bit more difficulty. She had never been ice skating before, and it showed. She wobbled and stumbled, her arms flailing as she struggled to keep her balance. Atticus and Baby Lana tried to help her, but even their combined efforts couldn't keep NeNe from falling.\n\nAs the trio sat on the bench, nursing their scraped knees and bruised egos, Atticus couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. He had been so excited to share this experience with his friends, and now it seemed as though they were having a miserable time.\n\nBut as they watched the other skaters gliding gracefully around the rink, Atticus had an idea. \"You know what, guys?\" he said, turning to Baby Lana and NeNe. \"We're not giving up on this just yet. We're going to keep trying, and we're going to get better. We'll learn from our mistakes, and we'll be brave enough to face them head on.\"\n\nAnd with that, the trio laced up their skates once again and hit the ice. It wasn't easy, and there were still plenty of falls and stumbles along the way. But with each passing minute, they improved. They learned from their mistakes, and they became more confident in their abilities.\n\nAs the sun began to set on the ice rink, Atticus, Baby Lana, and NeNe skated off the ice, exhausted but triumphant. They had faced their fears and learned from their failures, and in the process, they had discovered something truly magical about themselves.\n\nAs they walked home through the snowy streets, Atticus couldn't help but feel grateful for the adventure they had just shared. It had been a day filled with challenges, but it had also been a day filled with growth, bravery, and friendship. And as they wrapped their arms around each other and laughed, Atticus knew that they would always remember this trip to New York City, and the lessons they had learned along the way."

By sacrificing our time and resources to help others, we open up a world of opportunities and benefits that not only improve our own lives, but also the lives of the people we help.\n\nVolunteerism exposes us to diverse backgrounds, experiences, and cultures \u2013 an education in and of itself. When we volunteer, we gain a better understanding of the issues that people in our community face. This expanded knowledge enhances our empathy and compassion, and can ultimately lead to more informed and effective action.\n\nVolunteering is also a powerful way to develop valuable skills that can help us in our personal and professional lives. Whether it be organizing, team-building, or leadership, volunteering provides us with a safe and meaningful environment in which to learn and grow.\n\nAnd let's not forget the impact that volunteerism has on the community itself. By giving our time and energy, we help to build a stronger, healthier, and more resilient community. We become part of something bigger than ourselves; a force for positive change, and an inspiration to others.\n\nIn conclusion, volunteerism is one of the most rewarding investments we can make in ourselves and those around us. The benefits are tangible, and the opportunities for growth and development are endless. So why not take the first step today and find a cause that speaks to you? You may be surprised by what you can achieve, and the impact you can have."

A highlight of the meal was my friend's dessert cheese plate, which was absolutely the most unique and flavorful cheeses I have ever tasted.

Aqui tienes:\n\nLa multiplicaci\u00f3n de matrices es una operaci\u00f3n matem\u00e1tica que consiste en multiplicar los elementos de dos matrices para obtener una tercera matriz resultante. Sin embargo, para que se pueda realizar la multiplicaci\u00f3n, es necesario que el n\u00famero de columnas de la primera matriz sea igual al n\u00famero de filas de la segunda matriz. En otras palabras, si la primera matriz es de tama\u00f1o m x n y la segunda es de tama\u00f1o n x p, entonces se puede realizar la multiplicaci\u00f3n y la matriz resultante tendr\u00e1 un tama\u00f1o de m x p.\n\nLa multiplicaci\u00f3n de matrices se realiza multiplicando cada elemento de una fila de la primera matriz por cada elemento de una columna de la segunda matriz y sumando los resultados. Este proceso se repite para cada par de fila-columna y se coloca el resultado en la matriz resultante.\n\nPor ejemplo, si tenemos las siguientes dos matrices:\n\nA = [2, 3, 4] B = [5, 6]\n[1, 0, 2] [7, 8]\n\nLa matriz A es de tama\u00f1o 2 x 3 y la matriz B es de tama\u00f1o 3 x 2. Para poder realizar la multiplicaci\u00f3n, debemos asegurarnos de que el n\u00famero de columnas de A sea igual al n\u00famero de filas de B. En este caso, es posible realizar la multiplicaci\u00f3n porque ambos valores son iguales a 3.\n\nLa matriz resultante de la multiplicaci\u00f3n ser\u00eda:\n\nC = [37, 42]\n[18, 20]\n\nPara calcular el elemento en la primera fila y primera columna de C, debemos multiplicar los elementos de la primera fila de A por los elementos de la primera columna de B y sumar los resultados:\n\nC[0,0] = 2 * 5 + 3 * 7 + 4 * 8 = 37\n\nPara calcular el elemento en la primera fila y segunda columna de C, debemos multiplicar los elementos de la primera fila de A por los elementos de la segunda columna de B y sumar los resultados:\n\nC[0,1] = 2 * 6 + 3 * 8 + 4 * 6 = 42\n\nY as\u00ed sucesivamente para los dem\u00e1s elementos de la matriz resultante.\n\nEs importante destacar que la multiplicaci\u00f3n de matrices no es conmutativa, es decir, en general A x B no es lo mismo que B x A, por lo que el orden de las matrices es importante al realizar la multiplicaci\u00f3n."

The total budget for house and food rental is represented by the equation x + (60x / 100) = 240. The equation becomes 100x + 60x = 24000 after multiplying each term by 100 to get rid of the fraction. By combining like terms, the equation becomes 160x = 24000. Thus, the value of x is 24000 / 160 = 150 which represents the house rental budget. So, Luna's food budget is $240 - $150 = $90. Her phone bill budget is $90 x 10 / 100 = $9. Therefore, Luna's monthly budget for all those expenses is $240 (house and food) + $9 (phone) = $249.\n A: 249",

It is marked by people who have not found love dressing in dark color1s and commiserating    over meals of black food, with the dish of choice being Chinese-style noodles topped with a thick sauce of black bean paste.   \"I had a miserable time on Valentine ' s Day, felt even lonelier on White Day and now I' m crying over a bowl of' black noodles,\" said a young woman, \"Things better be different next year.     At universities across the country on Monday, students without lunch dates ordered black noodles, dined with other lonely hearts and searched for companionship, South Korea marketers have used special days for the 14th of each month to create a calendar full of love. Some days have gained attraction such as Black Day, while others such as Green Day in August, when couples are supposed to drink cheap wine that comes in green bottles and walk in the woods, have yet to attract much of a following. Black Day events have snowballed, with a major matchmaking service this year providing an evening of speed dating where the dish of choice is sushi blackened by squid ink.

The new camera will help space station astronauts add new pieces onto the orbiting  station. Mr Arthur and his Russian crewmate left the or biting station unmanned during the 5 - hour spacewalk. Normally, one crew member stayed aboard while two others worked outside. But the space station crew has been reduced to two since the space shuttle prefix = st1 /Columbiadisaster in 2003, and it has been left empty nine times during spacewalks since then. The device thrown overboard was once used to collect data on electrical activity around the space station. It was designed to work for only a few months and was no longer needed. Engineers were afraid pieces might break off and damage the space station, so they decided to cut it loose.

BEIJING -- A Chinese farmer was sentenced to 13 years in prison Monday for stealing art pieces from the Forbidden City last year, court authorities said. Shi Baikui, 27, was fined 13,000 yuan ($2,059) and was deprived   of his political rights for 3 years, according to the ruling announced by the Second Intermediate People's Court in Beijing Monday morning. Shi, from East China's Shandong Province, broke into the heavily guarded former home of Chinese emperors in the heart of Beijing, and stole nine art pieces made of gold and jewels, on May 8, 2011, the court said in a statement. While hurriedly escaping, Shi left behind five of the pieces in the Forbidden City's compound . Failing to immediately sell the treasures, he threw the other four pieces away the next day, the document said. Six pieces were recovered and the three missing were worth about 150,000 yuan ($23,760) in total. Shi was arrested by police at an Internet cafe in Beijing's Fengtai district 58 hours after the theft. Question: We can infer from the news that the new iPad   _  .

A higher number of electrons in the d suborbitals can lead to stronger bonds and a faster reaction rate, while a lower number of electrons can result in weaker bonds and a slower reaction rate. Additionally, the presence of unpaired electrons in the d suborbitals can increase the reactivity of the transition metal by allowing it to form multiple bonds with reactants, leading to an enhanced reaction rate."

However, it was not originally called the Thanksgiving Day Parade; it was called the \"Macy\u2019s Christmas Parade,\" and its purpose was to kick off the holiday shopping season. The parade concluded with Santa Claus arriving at Macy's flagship store in Herald Square.\n\nThe first parade was a great success, with an estimated 250,000 people in attendance, and it became an annual event. In 1927, the parade introduced a new element that would become one of its most iconic features \u2013 the giant helium-filled character balloons, starting with Felix the Cat. Over the years, the parade has continued to evolve, adding new elements and changing its route, but it remains a beloved annual tradition that millions of Americans watch on television or attend in person, celebrating the start of the holiday season with their families."

We use Vercel for hosting multiple nextjs applications, PlanetScale to host a mysql database, Sanity as a headless CMS, Clerk.dev as IAM, and Axiom for full-stack logging. How can I achieve automated reports of the cost from these serves?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "To automate the creation of cost reports for multiple services like Vercel, PlanetScale, Sanity, Clerk.dev, and Axiom, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather API credentials and documentation: Obtain API keys or credentials for each service. Familiarize yourself with each service's API documentation to understand how to query cost and usage data.\n2. Create a script or application: Use a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, JavaScript, or Go) to create a script or application that will collect cost data from each service's API.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of what the script or application should do for each service:\n\n* Vercel: Fetch project and team information, then retrieve the billing information for each project or team. Refer to the Vercel API documentation (<https://vercel.com/docs/api>) for more information.\n* PlanetScale: Retrieve billing and usage data from the PlanetScale API. Documentation can be found at <https://docs.planetscale.com/reference>.\n* Sanity: Sanity doesn't provide a direct API to retrieve billing information. You can either extract this information manually and input it into your script, or consider automating the extraction process through web scraping or by using a headless browser to log in to your Sanity account and retrieve billing details.\n* Clerk.dev: Clerk.dev does not offer a public API for billing information retrieval. Similar to Sanity, you can use web scraping or headless browser techniques to extract the required data from your Clerk.dev dashboard.\n* Axiom: Fetch the billing and usage information from the Axiom API. Check their API documentation for more information (<https://docs.axiom.co/api>).\n1. Aggregate and process the data: Once you've collected cost data from each service, aggregate and process the data in a way that makes sense for your reports. You may want to calculate the total cost, cost per service, or other metrics relevant to your organization.\n2. Generate the report: Use a report generation library or tool to create a visually appealing and informative report. Popular options include generating PDFs with libraries like ReportLab (Python) or Puppeteer (JavaScript), or creating Excel/CSV files with libraries like XlsxWriter (Python) or ExcelJS (JavaScript).\n3. Automate the process: Schedule your script or application to run at a specific interval (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly) using a scheduler like cron (Linux), Task Scheduler (Windows), or a cloud-based solution like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.\n4. Distribute the report: Configure your script or application to automatically send the generated reports to relevant stakeholders via email or another communication channel.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a cost aggregation report for your various cloud and serverless services, and automate the process for ongoing monitoring and analysis."

And each time, the campaign has passed. Over that same period, every other GOP candidate has given multiple interviews to CNN. Only Rubio has been absent. Meanwhile, the Florida senator has appeared on several other news networks.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Rubio spokesperson Alex Conant said simply: \"We don't comment on our media strategy.\"\n\nRubio's last appearance on CNN was August 7, and it got tense.\n\nIt was the day following the first GOP presidential debate on Fox News, and CNN's Chris Cuomo questioned Rubio's position on abortion. The two debated on-air for several minutes about whether Rubio's support of legislation that included a carve-out for abortion in cases of rape and incest amounted to support for the carve-out itself.\n\n\"So it seems that you had your own record wrong. Is that something you want to correct this morning?\" Cuomo said.\n\nThe normally polished Rubio appeared to stumble a bit before saying that Cuomo had it wrong. \"No, I, that's, that's. That's not true,\" Rubio said.\n\nLater in the interview, Rubio and Cuomo debated over when life begins, and whether science had settled that question.\n\n\"Science has not decided it's at conception,\" Cuomo said.\n\nRubio hit back: \"No, let me correct you. Science has. Absolutely it has.\"\n\nIt's certainly not uncommon for politicians to feud with media organizations. Trump has warred with Fox News throughout the campaign, even publicly threatening to boycott the outlet last month. But Rubio hasn't been vocal about his qualms with CNN or Cuomo.\n\nSince that Aug. 7 interview, Rubio has steadily gained support in the polls. And as his stock has risen, Rubio has been visible on other television outlets.\n\nOn Monday alone, he sat down for interviews with both CNBC's John Harwood and Fox News' Megyn Kelly. Rubio was also the subject of a profile that has aired multiple times on Fox News in the last 24 hours.\n\nAnd on Tuesday morning, Rubio continued his media blitz with appearances on \"Fox & Friends\" and NBC's \"Today\" show.\n\n--CNN's Tom LoBianco contributed reporting.\n\nCNNMoney (New York) October 6, 2015: 2:05 PM ET\n\nWrite a one or two sentence summary.\n\nSummary:",

    "instruction": "Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: Context_1 : Charles Edward Ives ( ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American modernist composer. He is one of the first American composers of international renown, though his music was largely ignored during his life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Over time, he came to be regarded as an \"American original\". He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century. Context_2 : Daniel Evan Freeman (born 27 April 1959) is an American musicologist who specializes in European art music of the eighteenth century, in particular the musical culture of eighteenth-century Prague and the Bohemian lands. He is also active as a pianist and music editor. Context_3 : Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, and more flippantly, real music or normal music) is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. \"Serious\" or \"cultivated\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called \"vernacular music\"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \"serious music\" and \"light music\". Context_4 : In the history of European art music, the term \"common practice period\" refers to the era between the formation and the dissolution of the tonal system. Though there are no exact dates for this phenomenon, most features of the common-practice period persisted from the mid to late baroque period, through the Classical and Romantic periods, or roughly from around 1650 to 1900. While certain prevailing patterns and conventions characterize the music of this period, the time period also saw considerable stylistic evolution. Some conventions evolved during this period that were rarely employed at other times during what may still be labeled \"common practice\" (for example, Sonata Form). Thus, the dates 1650\u20131900 are necessarily nebulous and arbitrary borders that depend on context. The most important unifying feature through this time period concerns a harmonic language to which modern music theorists can apply Roman numeral analysis. Context_5 : The Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht (\"Utrecht Early Music Festival\") is an annual music festival that showcases and celebrates early European art music. The ten-day festival takes place in the Dutch city of Utrecht, and begins in August. The programme comprises concerts, activities, lectures, exhibitions, and a symposium. Context_6 : Assaf Shelleg (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05e1\u05e3 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d2\u200e \u200e ), is a musicologist and pianist, a senior lecturer of musicology at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was previously the Schusterman Visiting Assistant Professor of Musicology and Jewish Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia (2011\u201314), and had taught prior to that as the visiting Efroymson Scholar in the Jewish, Islamic & Near Eastern Languages and Cultures Department at Washington University in St. Louis (2009\u201311). Shelleg specializes in twentieth-century Jewish and Israeli art music and has published in some of the leading journals in both musicology and Israel Studies on topics ranging from the historiography of modern Jewish art music to the theological networks of Israeli art music. Shelleg's book, \"Jewish Contiguities and the Soundtrack of Israeli History\", appeared in November 2014 with Oxford University Press. The book studies the emergence of modern Jewish art music in central and Western Europe (1910s-1930s) and its translocation to Palestine/Israel (1930s-1970s), exposing the legacies of European antisemitism and religious Judaism in the making of Israeli art music. Moving to consider the dislocation of modern Jewish art music the book examines the paradoxes embedded in a Zionist national culture whose rhetoric negated its pasts, only to mask process of hybridizations enchained by older legacies. \"Jewish Contiguities\" has won the 2015 Engle Prize for the study of Hebrew Music, and the 2016 Jordan Schnitzer Book Award. Context_7 : Vocal harmony is a style of vocal music in which a consonant note or notes are simultaneously sung as a main melody in a predominantly homophonic texture. Vocal harmonies are used in many subgenres of European art music, including Classical choral music and opera and in the popular styles from many Western cultures ranging from folk songs and musical theater pieces to rock ballads. In the simplest style of vocal harmony, the main vocal melody is supported by a single backup vocal line, either at a pitch which is above or below the main vocal line, often in thirds or sixths which fit in with the chord progression used in the song. In more complex vocal harmony arrangements, different backup singers may sing two or even three other notes at the same time as each of the main melody notes, mostly with consonant, pleasing-sounding thirds, sixths, and fifths (although dissonant notes may be used as short passing notes). Context_8 : David Wallis Reeves (February 14, 1838 \u2013 March 8, 1900), also known as D. W. Reeves or Wally Reeves, was an American composer, cornetist, and bandleader. He developed the American march style, later made famous by the likes of John Philip Sousa, and his innovations include adding a countermelody to the American march form in 1876. Sousa called Reeves \"The Father of Band Music in America\", and stated he wished he himself had written Reeves' \"Second Regiment Connecticut National Guard March\". Charles Ives also borrowed from the \"Second Connecticut\" on four occasions. Context_9 : \"Indian classical music is one of many forms of art music that have their roots in particular regional cultures.

For example, you can set the value of an input field using the `value` attribute:\n```\ndocument.getElementById('inputField').value = req.query.inputValue;\n```\n1. If you want to update the form when the page is first loaded, you can use a function that runs when the page is loaded. You can use the `window.onload` event to run a function when the page is finished loading:\n```\nwindow.onload = function() {\n  // update form fields using req.query values\n}\n```\n1. If you want the form to update itself whenever the query parameters change, you can use the `window.onpopstate` event to run a function whenever the browser's history changes. The `window.onpopstate` event is triggered when the user navigates back or forward through their history:\n```\nwindow.onpopstate = function() {\n  // update form fields using req.query values\n}\n```\nI hope this helps!

Passage:In Canada under British rule, gristmills distilled surplus grains to avoid spoilage. Most of these early whiskies would have been rough, mostly unaged wheat whiskey. Distilling methods and technologies were brought to Canada by American and European immigrants with experience in distilling wheat and rye. This early whisky from improvised stills, often with the grains closest to spoilage, was produced with various, uncontrolled proofs and was consumed, unaged, by the local market. While most distilling capacity was taken up producing rum, a result of Atlantic Canada's position in the British sugar trade, the first commercial scale production of whisky in Canada began in 1801 when John Molson purchased a copper pot still, previously used to produce rum, in Montreal. With his son Thomas Molson, and eventually partner James Morton, the Molsons operated a distillery in Montreal and Kingston and were the first in Canada to export whisky, benefiting from Napoleonic Wars' disruption in supplying French wine and brandies to England. Gooderham and Worts began producing whisky in 1837 in Toronto as a side business to their wheat milling but surpassed Molson's production by the 1850s as it expanded their operations with a new distillery in what would become the Distillery District. Henry Corby started distilling whisky as a side business from his gristmill in 1859 in what became known as Corbyville and Joseph Seagram began working in his father-in-law's Waterloo flour mill and distillery in 1864, which he would eventually purchase in 1883. Meanwhile, Americans Hiram Walker and J.P. Wiser moved to Canada: Walker to Windsor in 1858 to open a flour mill and distillery and Wiser to Prescott in 1857 to work at his uncle's distillery where he introduced a rye whisky and was successful enough to buy the distillery five years later. The disruption of American Civil War created an export opportunity for Canadian-made whiskies and their quality, particularly those from Walker and Wiser who had already begun the practice of aging their whiskies, sustained that market even after post-war tariffs were introduced. In the 1880s, Canada's National Policy placed high tariffs on foreign alcoholic products as whisky began to be sold in bottles and the federal government instituted a bottled in bond program that provided certification of the time a whisky spent aging and allowed deferral of taxes for that period, which encouraged aging. In 1890 Canada became the first country to enact an aging law for whiskies, requiring them to be aged at least two years. The growing temperance movement culminated in prohibition in 1916 and distilleries had to either specialize in the export market or switch to alternative products, like industrial alcohols which were in demand in support of the war effort.\n Links: a.

The winding mystery can be compared to a beautiful winding road with many forks, not knowing which way it will proceed and when.

A mysterious figure, clad in a black cloak, slowly made their way through the forest, careful not to make a sound. As they went deeper into the woods, they could hear the faint sounds of owls and nightjars, and the howling of wolves in the distance. They stopped at the edge of a clearing and drew back their hood, revealing a face weathered by the hardships they experienced in life. The figure raised their hands in preparation to cast a spell, and the trees seemed to dance to the melody of their voice. A green light filled the clearing, and a portal opened, beckoning the figure to take one final journey. With a deep breath, the mysterious figure stepped through the portal and disappeared into the night."

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.\n\nInput:\nContext_1 : Charles Edward Ives ( ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American modernist composer. He is one of the first American composers of international renown, though his music was largely ignored during his life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Over time, he came to be regarded as an \"American original\". He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century. Context_2 : Daniel Evan Freeman (born 27 April 1959) is an American musicologist who specializes in European art music of the eighteenth century, in particular the musical culture of eighteenth-century Prague and the Bohemian lands. He is also active as a pianist and music editor. Context_3 : Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, and more flippantly, real music or normal music) is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. \"Serious\" or \"cultivated\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called \"vernacular music\"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \"serious music\" and \"light music\". Context_4 : In the history of European art music, the term \"common practice period\" refers to the era between the formation and the dissolution of the tonal system. Though there are no exact dates for this phenomenon, most features of the common-practice period persisted from the mid to late baroque period, through the Classical and Romantic periods, or roughly from around 1650 to 1900. While certain prevailing patterns and conventions characterize the music of this period, the time period also saw considerable stylistic evolution. Some conventions evolved during this period that were rarely employed at other times during what may still be labeled \"common practice\" (for example, Sonata Form). Thus, the dates 1650\u20131900 are necessarily nebulous and arbitrary borders that depend on context. The most important unifying feature through this time period concerns a harmonic language to which modern music theorists can apply Roman numeral analysis. Context_5 : The Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht (\"Utrecht Early Music Festival\") is an annual music festival that showcases and celebrates early European art music. The ten-day festival takes place in the Dutch city of Utrecht, and begins in August. The programme comprises concerts, activities, lectures, exhibitions, and a symposium. Context_6 : Assaf Shelleg (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05e1\u05e3 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d2\u200e \u200e ), is a musicologist and pianist, a senior lecturer of musicology at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was previously the Schusterman Visiting Assistant Professor of Musicology and Jewish Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia (2011\u201314), and had taught prior to that as the visiting Efroymson Scholar in the Jewish, Islamic & Near Eastern Languages and Cultures Department at Washington University in St. Louis (2009\u201311). Shelleg specializes in twentieth-century Jewish and Israeli art music and has published in some of the leading journals in both musicology and Israel Studies on topics ranging from the historiography of modern Jewish art music to the theological networks of Israeli art music. Shelleg's book, \"Jewish Contiguities and the Soundtrack of Israeli History\", appeared in November 2014 with Oxford University Press. The book studies the emergence of modern Jewish art music in central and Western Europe (1910s-1930s) and its translocation to Palestine/Israel (1930s-1970s), exposing the legacies of European antisemitism and religious Judaism in the making of Israeli art music. Moving to consider the dislocation of modern Jewish art music the book examines the paradoxes embedded in a Zionist national culture whose rhetoric negated its pasts, only to mask process of hybridizations enchained by older legacies. \"Jewish Contiguities\" has won the 2015 Engle Prize for the study of Hebrew Music, and the 2016 Jordan Schnitzer Book Award. Context_7 : Vocal harmony is a style of vocal music in which a consonant note or notes are simultaneously sung as a main melody in a predominantly homophonic texture. Vocal harmonies are used in many subgenres of European art music, including Classical choral music and opera and in the popular styles from many Western cultures ranging from folk songs and musical theater pieces to rock ballads. In the simplest style of vocal harmony, the main vocal melody is supported by a single backup vocal line, either at a pitch which is above or below the main vocal line, often in thirds or sixths which fit in with the chord progression used in the song. In more complex vocal harmony arrangements, different backup singers may sing two or even three other notes at the same time as each of the main melody notes, mostly with consonant, pleasing-sounding thirds, sixths, and fifths (although dissonant notes may be used as short passing notes).

The dry bean seeds contain a store of nutrients just waiting to be released when they sprout. Under the right conditions they will germinate  .  As they grow, the food value of the seeds is multiplied into vitamins, minerals   and other nutrients. This happens almost overnight! It is easy to grow your own sprouts, but you need to buy your seeds from supermarkets or health food stores. Seeds for planting in the garden are often powdered with chemicals, so when becoming sprouts they are not safe to eat. Try growing sprouts from a variety of beans and seeds. You will find different sprouts at different stages. Bean sprouts are best when they are about three centimeters long. Wheat and sunflower sprouts taste best when the sprouts and the seeds are of the same length. If the sunflower sprout is too long it leaves a funny stinging feeling in the throat after eating. Alfalfa sprouts are best when their small leaves are well developed. Pea and soybean sprouts are good long or short. If you leave your sprouts in filtered sunlight for a few hours, the leaves will turn green as chlorophyll   is added.

Aragon was a proud dragon, but he was never boastful, for he had suffered a great loss \u2013 that of a family treasure, which was a beautiful pendant passed down through generations of dragons.\n\nAragon searched every part of the kingdom for the lost treasure, but it was nowhere to be found. Desperate, he ventured out into the dark, treacherous forests and over the steep, rocky mountains. Nothing could deter him from his quest. As he flew over the land, he was determined to never give up until he found his precious heirloom.\n\nBut it was in a deep, damp cave where Aragon finally found what he was looking for. There, shining in the midst of the darkness, was his family's lost treasure. With great care, Aragon scooped up the pendant into his claws and examined it closely. It was just as he remembered it - a beautiful, intricately designed piece of jewelry that sparkled in the dim light of the cave.\n\nFeeling a great sense of joy and relief, Aragon let out a mighty roar to announce that he had found the lost treasure. The sound echoed through the cave and out into the world, reaching the ears of all the kingdom. Everyone rejoiced, for they knew that the dragon had found what he had been looking for.\n\nWith the lost treasure back in his possession, Aragon returned home to the kingdom. He was greeted with cheers and admiration, for they all knew how hard he had searched and how determined he had been. And as for Aragon, he felt a deep sense of contentment, knowing that the family treasure was safe and sound once more.\n\nFrom that day on, Aragon wore the pendant around his neck as a symbol of his great adventure and perseverance. And whenever he looked at it, he was reminded that no matter how hard the journey may be, with determination and courage, one can always find what they are searching for."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Certainly! The Langmuir sheath effect is an important phenomenon in plasma physics, particularly in the context of plasma-surface interactions. In the fluid model, plasmas are treated as fluids rather than individual particles, which simplifies the analysis and allows for a more manageable approach to understanding complex plasma behavior.\n\nThe Langmuir sheath, named after physicist Irving Langmuir, is a region near the boundary between a plasma and a solid surface, such as a wall or an electrode. In this region, an electric field forms due to the difference in mobility between positive ions and negative electrons. Since electrons are much lighter and more mobile than ions, they tend to move more quickly towards the surface, creating a net positive charge in the sheath region.\n\nHere are the key aspects of the Langmuir sheath effect in the fluid model:\n\n1. Debye shielding: In a plasma, Debye shielding occurs when mobile charged particles arrange themselves around a charged object in a way that neutralizes its electric field. This creates a Debye length, which is the distance over which these charged particles can effectively shield the electric field. The thickness of the sheath is typically on the order of the Debye length.\n2. Electric field: The electric field within the sheath region accelerates ions towards the surface and repels electrons, maintaining the charge separation. This field is responsible for the sheath's potential drop, which can be several times the electron temperature in the plasma.\n3. Quasi-neutrality: Outside the sheath region, the plasma is quasi-neutral, meaning that the number densities of positive and negative charges are approximately equal. Inside the sheath, however, the positive ion density dominates.\n4. Sheath boundary: The boundary between the plasma and the sheath is called the \"sheath edge\" or \"sheath entrance.\" At this point, the ion and electron fluxes are equal. As you move further into the sheath, the ion flux increases due to the electric field's acceleration.\n5. Ion and electron temperatures: In the fluid model, ion and electron temperatures can be different, and these differences affect the behavior of the sheath. Generally, electron temperatures are higher than ion temperatures, causing a larger potential drop across the sheath.\n6. Ion and electron currents: The fluid model considers the currents carried by ions and electrons in the plasma. In the sheath region, the ion current dominates, while the electron current is significantly reduced due to the repulsive electric field.\n\nUnderstanding the Langmuir sheath effect is crucial for applications involving plasma-surface interactions, such as plasma etching, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and fusion devices. The fluid model provides a useful framework for studying these effects by simplifying the complex behavior of plasmas into a more tractable form."

    "output": "Radio revolutionized communication and reduced the problem of geographic distance by enabling people to transmit and receive information over long distances, in real-time, and without the need for physical transportation. Prior to the invention of radio, people relied on postal services, telegraphs, and messengers to communicate over long distances. However, these methods were often slow, unreliable, and expensive, and were limited by the physical distance between the sender and the receiver.\n\nWith the radio, people could transmit and receive voice and music signals over long distances using electromagnetic waves. These waves could travel through the air and were not limited by physical barriers such as mountains or oceans. As a result, the radio allowed people to communicate and share information with others who were far away, and in many cases, in other parts of the world.\n\nThe radio also played an important role in the dissemination of news and entertainment. Radio broadcasters could transmit news, music, and other content to large audiences, regardless of their location. This enabled people to learn about events happening in other parts of the world, and to be entertained by content that was not available in their local area.\n\nOverall, the radio reduced the problem of geographic distance by enabling people to communicate and share information with others over long distances, in real-time, and without the need for physical transportation. This has had a significant impact on many areas of life, including business, politics, entertainment, and education, and has helped to create a more connected and globalized world."

But I'd encourage you to embrace them. It can be hard to talk about hate, prejudice, why the police weren't always the good guys. However, I have also been able to have beautiful, hopeful discussions with my children about these issues as well. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nAnswer:",

This AI system would be designed with AGI capabilities and would have the ability to think and reason like a human, but with additional processing power and vast amounts of data to draw on.\n\nThe AI system as a wall-facer would have several advantages, such as being able to process massive amounts of data in a fraction of the time it would take a human and being able to make strategic decisions with a level of precision that a human might not be able to match. The AI would likely have several strategies to defend against an alien invasion, such as developing advanced defensive systems, improving communication and detection technologies, and utilizing predictive analytics to make strategic decisions. Additionally, this AI system might also work in conjunction with human experts to assess and evaluate potential risks and make decisions about resource allocation and deployment."

Review: Armed with the excellent and timeless information and techniques contained in this clever simulator, learning to use any other version of CorelDraw! is just a matter of checking out the new stuff. All the basics are contained in the easy lessons. You can learn as little or as much as you want, at your own speed, and repeat it as many times as necessary. The program keeps a log of your progress for your own information and even teaches you a bit about Windows. It is a DOS based program with an interface that mimics the CorelDraw! screen. Even though Corel is almost ready to release their 9th version, I can still recommend this well constructed teaching tool with complete confidence. Answer:\nA: Yes\n\nQ: Is this product review positive? Title: Promising more than delivering Review: The premise of this book is tantilizing: 1) The stock market will crash, and 2) here are some investment ideas to survive and prosper when the crash comes.The author presumes that when retiring baby boomers begin to withdraw their 401(k) and mutual fund assets there will be more \"sellers\" of shares than \"buyers\" - thus the market will fall. This is a two-dimensional vision of the marketplace, yet plausible.Regarding investment ideas for the reader: other than recommending the purchase of \"income producing\" real estate the second half of this book is hollow, and used by the author as little more than a platform for promoting his cash-flow board game and additional books he has written.I don't feel that the day I spent reading this book was wasted, however, I'm not going to recommend it to any of my \"thoughtful\" friends.

Answer:\nA: No\n\nQ: Is this product review positive? Title: A Sequel that Works Review: This followup to Volume 1 finds Bragg and Wilco continuing to do their best work (Bragg, especially) with the help of Woody Guthrie's great lyrics. Wilco have the best moments: the combo of \"Secret of the Sea\" (which is the albums best pop moment) and \"Remember the Mountain Bed\" are their peaks. While Bragg doesn't get anything as classic as the first volume's \"Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key\", he nevertheless gets off 2 great ones with \"Hot Rod Hotel\" and \"Black Wind Blowing\". As they were on MA1, Natalie Merchant and Corey Harris are back. Merchant's contribution is on the melancholy \"I Was Born\" (w/Bragg on acoustic guitar). It's a must hear. Corey Harris' \"Aginst Th' Law\" is a jaunty blues piece pitted against a politically charged Woody lyric. If the initial discovery of volume 1 is lost at first listen, give the record a couple of more spins (and then play it back to back with volume 1) and you'll then find that this is indeed a worthy sequel. Buy 'em both. Answer:",

Title: This movie was disappointing... Review: The movie starts where it leaves off at the end of Ong Bak 2. It felt like it was starting to be good, when the body healing process begins for Tony Jaa's character. The healing process continues... He's wrapped up like the guy on Kung fu Hustle, but for more than an hour of the movie. When he finally heals, the action isn't nearly as good as the other 2 Ong Bak movies. The villain he's waited to kill for his whole life is killed by some demon and it doesn't make sense. When he fights the demon it isn't that entertaining... This movie isn't a must see...

    "instruction": "Q: Worst Studio in Vegas for sure.  I have been doing yoga in this town for several years now & this is the one that continues to find a way to irk me almost everytime.  It's not the instructors, they are amazing.  However, the management in these studios seems more intent on greedily making money than actually providing a quality yoga experience for their communities.   I wrote this studio off awhile ago, but then last year decided to give them a second chance & join a friend for a \"community\" class which was supposed to be $10.  When I went to pay with a credit card, they informed me I would have to pay $17 if I was not going to pay with cash.  So you want to penalize me for not paying in cash?  Um, a bit ridiculous don't you think?  After driving all the way to the other side of town, I paid it & enjoyed my class.  But I thought I'd never return.   Then this year, Groupon had an 8 class pckg available for a significant reduction in price.  One of my favorite instructors teaches there right now & so I decided to give the \"Sanctuary\" a third try.  I was not informed that I only had 30 days from redeeming the groupon with the first class to use all 8 classes, I was under the impression I had until the Groupon expiration date.  So when I showed up for my third class I was told my Groupon had already expired.  They were completely unwilling to work with me.  So I left, drove down the street to Bodyheat Yoga & Pilates (an amazing studio btw) & paid even more than $17 for one of their classes.  For a studio like Yoga Sanctuary to charge what they do when they do not provide adequate space for changing, showering, etc... is ridiculous.   Also, if you work at night, you don't have much choice of day classes, they have a limited number available, & nothing in the afternoons on any day except Saturday.   Most importantly, the spirit of yoga is one of giving, one of a generous spirit.  I do not begrudge a studio trying to make a profit & run a business.

    "input": "",
    "output": "A woman was beaten up - this is the price Angolans pay for dissent.\nMr Marques might pay a far higher price for criticising seven army generals, whom he has accused of complicity in killings, torture and corruption in Angola's diamond fields.\nThey, in turn, have accused him of criminal defamation and are suing him for $1.2m (\u00c2\u00a3800,000).\nIf found guilty, Mr Marques could go to prison for nine years.\nFor the generals, $1.2m is peanuts. They are part of Angola's tiny elite, which revolves around the 72-year-old president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and which has become rich on the country's oil and diamond wealth.\nSince four decades of conflict ended in 2002, Angola's economy has skyrocketed, albeit from a low base.\nAccording to the auditors Ernst and Young, it was the world's fastest growing economy from 2000-10.\nBut wealth and power have stayed largely in the hands of a very few families, who come closer that anything else I have seen on the continent to an African nobility.\nThe book that has landed Mr Marques in so much trouble, Blood Diamonds: Corruption and Torture in Angola, alleges the army and private security companies have been involved in burying miners alive, executing them en masse, and forcing them to leap to their deaths from speeding vehicles.\nMr Marques says the miners were made to jump off at intervals \"so as to scatter the evidence of their deaths\".\nThe generals deny these allegations.\nBlood Diamonds shows how blurred the lines are between business, politics and violence.\nIt alleges members of the president's inner circle occupy several positions at once, serving simultaneously as top officials in the military, shareholders in diamond mining companies, and co-owners of the private security firms hired by the mining companies to secure the diamond fields.\nThe Angolan elite lives in a world almost entirely disconnected from the rest of the country's population of 20 million.\nIts playground is the Ilha, a stretch of sand that curves out from Luanda, dotted with luxury villas, beachside restaurants and glitzy nightclubs.\nThe rich and the beautiful sip $60 cocktails, as gleaming Porsches purr past, the wrists of their drivers heavy with Rolex watches.\nPrices are astronomical. It is as if they have been set deliberately high to enable people to show off just how wealthy they are.\nWhy else would supermarkets charge up to $100 for a watermelon, $200 for a chicken?\nLooking out at Luanda from the Ilha, it is hard to believe this is the capital of a country that a little more than 10 years ago was fighting a vicious civil war.\nShiny white super-yachts luxuriate in the blue of the sea.\nA swarm of new skyscrapers lines the horizon. One of the multi-million-dollar penthouse apartments has a helicopter landing pad.\nIt is here one starts to hear whispers of the name \"Isabel\": \"This nightclub belongs to Isabel,\" \"This is Isabel's restaurant,\" \"That business is Isabel's, so is that one, that one, and that one.\"\nIsabel is the eldest daughter of President Dos Santos.\nWorth an estimated $3.4bn, she has been described by Forbes magazine as Africa's richest woman.\nMeanwhile, an estimated 70% of Angola's population survives on less than $2 a day - 90% of Luanda's population lives in slums.\nA great deal of energy is spent trying to remove the poor from the sight of Angola's hyper-rich. Their shacks are bulldozed regularly.\nThe Chinese have built for them a new satellite city called Zango, dozens of kilometres from Luanda.\nIts multicoloured tower blocks rise up from the scrubland, as if it had been dropped from outer space.\nIt is the urban poor that most worries the Angolan elite.\nThe security forces have moved swiftly to crush a growing number of small anti-government protests.\nI met slum-dweller Mbanza Hamza, who has chosen to stand up to the authorities.\nHe has a large dent in his skull to show for it.\n\"Men came in the night and beat me with clubs,\" he says. \"They wore plain clothes but I know who sent them.\"\nMoney is the most effective tool for dealing with resistance. The government makes sure local beer stays cheap - it costs less than $1 a bottle.\nIt sponsors football clubs and pop concerts, and encourages churches; anything to distract the poor.\nFree drinks and T-shirts were enough to make sure that, on the eve of an opposition protest, a huge \"pro-government\" march was held.\nThird largest economy in Africa, with a GDP of $121bn in 2013.\nChina's principal trading partner in Africa, and the USA's second.\nClassed as a \"Low Human Development\" country, coming 149/187 in the UN's Human Development Index for 2014.\nChild and maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the world - about one child in five doesn't surviving to the age of five, maternal mortality is 610 per 100,000 live births (UNICEF).\nLuanda: Most Expensive City in the World for Expatriates (Mercer Cost of Living Survey, 2014).\n$32 billion went missing from Angola's oil accounts between 2007 and 2010 (IMF).\n98% of bridges (more than 300), 80% of factories and schools, 60% of hospitals and most of roads destroyed in civil war (Economist Intelligence Unit).\n63.7% of Angola's population is under 25 years old (Unicef).\nIs Angola a ticking time-bomb waiting to explode?\nThe government can no longer use the war as an excuse not to do more about health, education and the redistribution of wealth.\nIt has brought in the Chinese to build roads and railways, but the population is starting to expect more than infrastructure and peace.\nIt is unlikely cases such as that of Mr Marques will lead to significant international pressure on Angola to do more about human rights and corruption.\nDuring his 35 years in power, President Dos Santos has developed remarkable cunning in playing off one foreign power against the other, just like he does in domestic politics.\nBut the president is not immortal.\nThe question is whether his, as yet unappointed, successor will have the skills to keep money and power \"in the family\", while using fear and temptation to defuse the frustrations of the poor."

Jack was always fascinated with stories of travel and adventure, and he dreamed of one day seeing the world for himself. He worked hard, saved his money, and when he turned 25, he decided to take a year out of his life to go and explore the world.\n\nJack started his journey in Europe, where he visited many of the famous cities including Paris, Berlin, and Rome. He marveled at their history and beauty, and made many friends along the way. From there, he journeyed east to Asia, where he saw the bright lights of Tokyo and explored the ancient temples of Thailand. In China, he climbed the Great Wall, and in India he experienced the colorful chaos of Delhi, and the serenity of the Taj Mahal.\n\nFrom India, Jack flew down to Africa, where he joined a safari trip, and saw elephants and lions roaming free in the wild. He then traveled to Egypt, where he was awed by the pyramids and the history that surrounded them. After that, Jack crossed the ocean to South America, where he hiked the Inca Trail, and saw the sunrise over Machu Picchu.\n\nFrom South America, Jack traveled north through Central America, stopping in Costa Rica to see the rainforests and volcanoes, and then onto Mexico, where he learned about the ancient Mayan civilization. Finally, he arrived in the United States where he traveled from coast to coast, seeing everything from the Grand Canyon to New York City.\n\nAfter a year of traveling, Jack returned home to England, a changed man. He had seen so much and experienced so many new things, that he now saw the world in a different light. He had made friends all over the world, and had memories that would last him a lifetime. But most of all, he had fulfilled his dream of traveling around the world, and in doing so, he had discovered a whole new world within himself."

    "instruction": "Provide a hermeneutic analysis of this narrative: \n\nSpeak of the devil. Spit at a wizard. Drink with a ghost. Welcome to Night Vale. Our top story, obviously, is that after being closed for remodeling, Big Rico\u2019s Pizza is back, baby! Wow, doesn\u2019t it seem like they\u2019ve been closed forever? It does to me. But it has only been one month. And of course, a month is forever to certain species of insects who live and die within the span of thirty days. Egg, larva, pupa, adult, breeder, corpse, dust\u2014all in the time it takes to remodel a pizza parlor. One of nature\u2019s little miracles. I have here a description of everything you can expect to see at the new and improved Big Rico\u2019s Pizza. Or, as they are now called, Big Rico\u2019s Pizza and Entertainment Zone. That\u2019s right, Big Rico\u2019s is serving up steaming hot slices of entertainment in addition to their famously satisfactory pizza. Customers can look forward to a classic Big Rico\u2019s atmosphere paired with a greater emphasis on family fun. Updates include a ball pit, a snake pit, a second ball pit with a few snakes hidden in it, Whack-a-Mole, and an animatronic rock band called The Table Scraps. Oh my god, I love animatronic pizza bands! I wish you all could see the promotional photos, these little guys are so cute. I have their band bio here. Rodney Rat, Pasha Possum, and Chrissy Cockroach are The Table Scraps! These \u201cparty animals\u201d (oh I get it, that\u2019s cute!) use state of the art A.I. technology to write their own songs and create their own fun dances, reacting in real time to their audience and also to the stock market ticker for some reason. We haven\u2019t been able to work that bug out. Anyway, unlike some entertainment pizza bands, they are totally not creepy at all. No child looks upon their waxy visage and weeps. No baby recoils in terror from their wildly jerking limbs or slowly blinking eyes. No parent flees from the mechanical clack of cloth-covered jaws singing along with warped recordings. The Table Scraps can turn any meal into an unforgettable jamboree! Well, I\u2019m very excited about this news. Esteban\u2019s birthday is coming up and Carlos and I have been wondering where we should have it. The grand reopening is happening right now, so head on down to check it out for yourselves. And please report back. Let\u2019s look now at the news. Numerous townspeople have been raptured this week. Like, way more than usual. And to clarify, I\u2019m using the verb \u201crapture\u201d as shorthand for \u201cgetting sucked into the sky.\u201d We have no reason to believe there are any religious implications to it. It appears to be exactly as meaningless as any other way to die. Though I\u2019m not gonna lie, it looks a little more exciting. Just walking down the street, thinking about what to get for lunch, and whooooop! Up you go! Like a balloon accidentally released from a baby\u2019s hand, catapulting toward breathtaking oblivion in a clear blue sky. Ironically getting colder and colder the closer you get to the sun. Thankfully disappearing from view before anyone below can witness the horrors of what happens to your body. I\u2019d normally give the names and biographical details of those we\u2019ve lost, but given the quantity, that\u2019s all still being sorted out. For now, I\u2019ll only say, you were loved and you will be missed forever, whoever you are. To those still with us, I would say \u201cstay safe out there,\u201d but individual behavior doesn\u2019t seem to matter on this one. That\u2019s kind of a relief, huh? Rules and precautions can get so tiresome. Ooh, looks like we have some updates on Big Rico\u2019s grand reopening. Something that involves a lockdown and the fire department. That seems like a bad combo. But first, traffic. There\u2019s a new stoplight at the intersection of Somerset and Main. It has one of those built-in cameras, so proceed with caution. You won\u2019t get a ticket but your picture will be published in a newsletter of bad drivers, as part of the traffic department\u2019s new Shame First policy. If you do stop at the light, please remember to resume driving immediately when it\u2019s your turn. The blinking light can become hypnotic. If you look at it for too long, you will forget things. Where you\u2019re going, where you came from. Someone\u2019s name right after you\u2019re introduced to them. Your internet passwords. Your car keys. That one\u2019s especially important because you\u2019re driving right now. They\u2019re supposed to be in your ignition. Now they\u2019re gone and you can\u2019t think of where they could possibly be. People are lining up behind you, honking and shouting for you to go through the light. You don\u2019t know what to do, so you put your hazards on. They blink synchronously with the stoplight. Red. Red. Red. The cacophony of honking fades away. The frenzied shouting and the angry sets of hands rocking at the sides of your car are a distant thrum. You haven\u2019t forgotten your keys and passwords and people\u2019s names. You\u2019ve transcended them. They\u2019re inconsequential. It\u2019s only you and the stoplight now. Red. Red. Red. This has been traffic. Now, back to the grand reopening of Big Rico\u2019s Pizza and Entertainment Zone. The fire department was called in by a neighbor who witnessed smoke and flames shooting from the windows. My brother-in-law Steve Carlsberg is on the phone with the full report, live on the scene. Go ahead, Steve.",

    "output": "The narrative provided is from \"Welcome to Night Vale,\" a podcast presented in a radio show format. The story is presented as news, with the host discussing recent events in the town of Night Vale.\n\nA hermeneutic analysis of this narrative would focus on the ways in which it constructs meaning through its use of language and narrative devices. One key aspect of the narrative is its use of surreal and absurd elements, such as the animatronic pizza band and the rapturing of townspeople. These elements serve to create a sense of unease and uncertainty, as they disrupt our expectations of what is normal and predictable.\n\nAt the same time, the narrative also uses humor and irony to comment on contemporary issues, such as the obsession with entertainment and the meaninglessness of individual behavior in the face of catastrophic events. The use of language is also noteworthy, as the narrator employs a distinctive style that blends the mundane with the bizarre, creating a unique tone that is both deadpan and surreal.\n\nOverall, the narrative can be seen as a commentary on the nature of reality and the ways in which we construct meaning through language and narrative. By disrupting our expectations and blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the narrative challenges us to question our assumptions and consider alternative perspectives on the world around us."

    "output": "Money is a system of exchange that allows people to trade goods and services with each other. In modern times, money has taken the form of currency, which can be exchanged for goods and services or used to represent value in financial transactions.\n\nGovernments around the world are responsible for creating and managing their respective currencies. They do this through central banks, which control the money supply, set interest rates, and regulate the financial system. Most currencies today are fiat currencies, which means their value is not backed by any physical commodity but is instead based on the faith and credit of the government that issues them.\n\nMoney is used for a wide range of purposes, including buying and selling goods and services, investing, saving, and lending. Banks play a crucial role in the economy by providing loans to individuals and businesses, which helps stimulate economic growth.\n\nIn addition to traditional currencies, there are also alternative forms of money, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. These digital currencies are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any central authority or government. Instead, they rely on complex algorithms and cryptography to regulate their supply and prevent fraud.\n\nOverall, money is a complex and dynamic system that plays a critical role in the global economy. Understanding how it works is essential for individuals and businesses alike to navigate the financial landscape and make informed decisions."

After opening it, she suddenly finds herself in strange land, but immediately passed out. She wakes up to find herself in a strange liquid-filled container, with all kinds of anthropomorphic creatures around her. She couldn't understand their language, but she quickly reached the conclusion that they were giving her some kind of drug for some reason. Noticing she had woken up, they start trying to ask her questions, but she doesn't understand. They look at eachother, then inject her with something, and she suddenly could understand them. \nThey explained she shouldn't be outside, that the air is poison, and has been for hundreds of years, ever since the world had chosen wealth over the future. Alice was terrified. She wanted to go home. Perhaps if she could, she could even prevent such a terrible future from happening. She picks up her phone. The app is still there, and has a date on it. Her eyes light up, and she goes back to the night before she found the app. \nShe suddenly finds herself in her room. She sees herself in her bed, and things about what sci-fi has told her: if you touch your past self, the universe ends. Alice had know way of knowing, of course, that just as the universe has laws for all kinds of physics, it has laws for time travel that prevent such things from physically being able to happen. Alice slowly backs up, but trips over her phone charger and drops her phone. She quickly grabs her phone and runs out of the room. She hides in a closet, and unlocking her phone, realized the app is gone. She must have accidentally swapped phones with her past self! She hears her alarm clock go off upstairs and realizes it is too late. Hearing her past self getting transported to the future, she returns and thinks about what she can do. \nSuddenly, Alice felt something in her mind. her knowledge felt endless. They must have done something to her in the future. Sitting down, she starting writing everything she now knew down. Who knew how long it would last? \n500 years late, an archaeologist finds one of Alice's books. He opens to a random page, and finds a chemical formula. Paying to have research done on the formula, it is synthesized in a lab, where an accident causes glasses to be unknowingly released. Those in the lab started to feel strange, but the damage was done. Over the next 20 years, their bodies slowly became less human and more animalistic. By the time they realized this, they were already producing large quantities of the chemical. Worldwide there were people experiencing symptoms. The scientists, wanting to put a stop to it, decided to sink the chemicals in ships, like what was done hundreds of hears before. In the process, the container got a whole in it, and released dangerously high amounts into the atmosphere, which stayed there for thousands of years."

Additionally, the user can make reservations and payments through the app, safely and securely.\n\n4. For some destinations, such as cities, beaches or mountains, the app could have a partnership to offer tours or suggestions for local experiences, restaurants, and shopping.\n\n5. It could also offer an itinerary planner so users could organize their daily activities by adding events, tours or visit points of interests.\n\n6. Integrating with other travel review sites or apps, users may see ratings and reviews, and images while planning their vacation for better decision making.\n\n7. The app could have reminder features for users to ensure they have all the necessary documents, passports, visas, and Travel vaccinations if they are needed for the destination\n\n8.

According to Archie, Kahuna rescued a group of children from an orphanage run by the evil (and unbelievably stereotypical) Kane. Kahuna and Kane are archnemesis' and hate each other, but Kahuna always wins their battles.Archie's father Stan, who seems to own the day care centre, is letting it be used as a television set by the evil Biscane (yes, in other words, Kane) who is starting up his own TV channel. Archie notices someone spying on the goings-on at the television set in the bushes, but he isn't sure who it is. However, he begins to believe Biscane is evil. Him and the other babies sneak into Stan's office and decide to check out Biscane, but are spammed. When they hear some of Biscane's cronies approaching, Rosita, Alex and Finkelman run away, leaving Archie by himself. Archie overhears the cronies talking about Biscane's plan, but he doesn't really understand it. However, he accidentally attracts their attention, but before they can get him, he is rescued by, you've guessed it, Kahuna, who is in fact REAL. (Of course.)

On the way to the museum they are stopped by loads of Biscane's other cronies. But Kahuna rescues them all, and the babies realise that Archie was telling the truth. Kahuna takes them all to his base in Hollywood, where they meet Zack, whom Kahuna took in years ago. Kahuna's base is in fact a huge playground, and Kylie finds it...weird. (Which it is.)

The latter proposes a risky operation to rescue Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona), the imprisoned leader of a Southern African nation who is due to be executed by General Ndofa, the man who deposed him. Limbani is currently being held in a remote prison in Zembala, guarded by a unit of Ndofa's personal troops known as the \"Simbas\". Faulkner accepts the assignment and begins recruiting 49 other mercenaries for the job, including officers he had worked with on previous operations: Rafer Janders (Richard Harris), a skilled military tactician who's made a living as an art dealer, and Shawn Fynn (Roger Moore), an ex-pilot who had been working as a currency smuggler for the London mafia. Shawn also brings in penniless South African Pieter Coetzee (Hardy Kr\u00c3\u00bcger), a former soldier in the South African Defence Force who wishes to return to his homeland and buy a farm. Hired soldiers include sergeants Tosh Donaldson (Ian Yule), Jock McTaggart (Ronald Fraser), Jesse Blake (John Kani), Derek Frice (Joe Cole), and a homosexual medic named Arthur Witty (Kenneth Griffith). Additional members in the group are Esposito, (Glyn Baker), Samuels (Brook Williams), Keith (Percy Herbert), Alexander (Ken Gampu), Newman, (George Lane Cooper), Finchley, (Ryno Hattingh), Gennaro (Graham Clarke), and many others.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley (Richard E.

Product information: This category includes all the details about a product such as its name, description, price, available quantities, etc.\n2. Customer information: This category includes all the details about a customer such as their name, address, contact details, etc.\n3. Order management: This category includes all the processes related to managing orders such as creating an order, updating an order, canceling an order, etc.\n4. Payment processing: This category includes all the processes related to payment such as accepting payments, processing refunds, etc.\n5. Inventory management: This category includes all the processes related to managing inventory such as tracking inventory levels, reordering products, etc.\n6. Customer service: This category includes all the processes related to providing customer support such as answering customer inquiries, resolving customer complaints, etc.\n7. Marketing and promotion: This category includes all the processes related to promoting products and attracting customers such as running promotions, advertising products, etc.\n8. Supply chain management: This category includes all the processes related to managing the flow of goods from the manufacturer to the customer such as sourcing products, logistics, etc.\n\nI hope this ontology provides a good starting point for understanding the various intents in the retail industry.

    "instruction": "Article: In 1978, I was 18 and was working as a nurse in a small town about 270 km away from Sydney, Australia. I was looking forward to having five days off from duty. Unfortunately, the only one train a day back to my home in Sydney had already left. So I thought I'd hitch a ride . I waited by the side of the highway for three hours but no one stopped for me. Finally, a man walked over and introduced himself as Gordon. He said that although he couldn't give me a lift, I should come back to his house for lunch. He noticed me standing for hours in the November heat and thought I must be hungry. I was doubtful as a young girl but he assured(...) me I was safe, and he also offered to help me find a lift home afterwards. When we arrived at his house, he made us sandwiches. After lunch, he helped me find a lift home. Twenty-five years later, in 2003, while I was driving to a nearby town one day, I saw an elderly man standing in the glaring heat, trying to hitch a ride. I thought it was another chance to repay someone for the favor I'd been given decades earlier. I pulled over and picked him up. I made him comfortable on the back seat and offered him some water. After a few moments of small talk, the man said to me, \"You haven't changed a bit, even your red hair is still the same.\" I couldn't remember where I'd met him. He then told me he was the man who had given me lunch and helped me find a lift all those years ago. It was Gordon. Question: The reason why the author offered a lift to the elderly man was that  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \"she wanted to repay the favor she once got\"?\nNo\n\n\nArticle: Michael Jordon is the greatest basketball player of all time. Once he was making a television commercial  . All Michael needed to do in the advertisement was to miss a shot. For Michael, this was difficult. He had conditioned himself to succeed whenever he was throwing the ball. Every time he threw a basketball, it went in. Every time he tried to miss a shot, he failed. In total, it took him over 20 attempts   before he missed a shot. For Michael, success is a strong habit. He had formed a habit that was so strong that it took him a lot of time to break it and \"fail\". Just like drinking, smoking and collecting things, success is also a habit. The only thing is, it is much more effective! Like all habits, once it is established  , it is difficult to break. Many people think that success is difficult to maintain  . They feel that it will be hard work and will need too much action and focus. The truth is that it is simply a habit, and as easy to maintain as any other habit. Spend some time making success a habit in your life. Once you have developed it, it is not something you will want to change again. Then, the only thing you will fail at is failing. Question: What do many people wrongly think of success? Yes or no, is the answer \"They think it needs too much action and focus.\"?\nNo\n\n\nQ: Article: Down on the beach of Dover,56-year-old Channel swimmer Jackie Cobell bravely set off for Calais.The time was 6:40 am.28 hours and 44 minutes later the exhausted,successful mother from Kent crawled   to the shore and walked proudly into the record books.After five years in training,Mrs.Cobell became the slowest person to cross the Channel under her own steam.The previous record for the slowest crossing,set by Henry Sullivan at 26 hours and 50 minutes,has stood for 87 years before Mrs.Cobell started at Dover Saturday morning. She had struggled through changing tides that swept her first one way,then the other.It turned the 21-mile crossing into a 65-mile one.She declared,\"Time and tide wait for no man--and they certainly didn't wait for me.I was fully expecting it to get dark before I got to Calais but I never imagined I'd also see the dawn again.But I wasn't going to give up.\" Her feat  raised more than $2,000 in charity sponsorship for research into Huntingdon's disease,a sum that was continuing to grow as news of her achievement spread.That was why she did it.\"I don't really know myself,\" she said.\"I just kept thinking of all the people I'd be letting down if I stopped.\" Mrs.Cobell took to the water so well at school.But after bringing up two daughters,she started to gain weight.Five years ago she took up swimming again and decided to prepare for the Channel challenge to lose weight.She became much fitter.Then came the big swim.\"I practiced on Windermere Lake,\" she said.\"it's about half the distance of the Channel so I just doubled it,added some extra time,and worked out I could probably get to Calais in about 16 hours.\" Her husband David,trainer,official observer and friend sailed alongside her on a boat.She said,\"I sang to keep myself going.When they told me I was a record breaker I thought they were just having a joke--until I realized it was the record for the slowest crossing.But maybe next time I might be a bit quicker.\" Question: Why did Mrs.Cobell spend so much time crossing the Channel? Yes or no, is the answer \"Because the tides changed her direction.\"?\nA: No\n\n\nQ: Article: One day in spring four men were riding on horseback along a country road. These men were lawyers, and they were going to the next town to attend court.  There had been a rain, and the ground was very soft. Water was dripping from the trees, and the grass was wet. The four lawyers rode along, one behind another, for the pathway was narrow, and the mud on each side of it was deep. They rode slowly, and talked and laughed and were very cheerful. As they were passing through a group of small trees, they heard a great fluttering over their heads and a weak sound made by small birds in the grass by the roadside. \"Stith! Stith! Stith!\" came from the leafy branches above them. \"Cheep! cheep! cheep!\" came from the wet grass. \"What is the matter here?\" asked the first lawyer, whose name was Speed. \"Oh, it's only some old robins !\"said the second lawyer, whose name was Hardin. \"The storm has blown two of the little ones out of the nest. They are too young to fly, and the mother bird is worried about them.\" \"What a pity! They'll die down there in the grass,\" said the third lawyer. \"Oh, well! They're nothing but birds,\" said Mr. Hardin. \"Why should we bother?\" \"Yes, why should we?\" said Mr. Speed. The three men, as they passed, looked down and saw the little birds fluttering in the cold, wet grass. They saw the mother robin flying about, and crying to her mate.

He got down from his horse and very gently took the little ones up in his big warm hands. They did not seem frightened, but cried softly, as if they knew they were safe. \"Never mind, my little fellows,\" said Mr. Lincoln \"I will put you in your own cozy little bed.\" Then he looked up to find the nest from which they had fallen. It was high, much higher than he could reach. But Mr. Lincoln could climb. He had climbed many a tree when he was a boy. He put the birds softly, one by one, into their warm...

How about the Ukraine impeachment inquiry? \u2014 but criminal charges, and a subsequent arrest, could have a dramatic effect on his 2024 campaign. Never before has a former president been charged with a crime.\n\nHere are the active investigations:\n\nThe Stormy Daniels hush money investigation (Manhattan District Attorney's Office)\nThis criminal case centers on a $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actor, made just before the 2016 election in order to quiet her allegations of an affair with Trump.\n\nWhat Trump's 'arrest' claim says about his hold on politics and the 2024 election\nPOLITICS\nWhat Trump's 'arrest' claim says about his hold on politics and the 2024 election\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, says that she and Trump had an affair at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006. As Trump's campaign for president picked up steam, she offered to sell her story to gossip magazines. In October, executives at the National Enquirer, a publication long friendly to Trump, alerted Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nCohen reached an agreement with Daniels to pay her $130,000 in exchange for keeping her story quiet. Her attorney received the money from Cohen on Oct. 27, less than two weeks before the election.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Cohen was reimbursed with a total of $420,000, to account for taxes and other costs. Some of the reimbursement checks were signed by Trump himself, who has admitted to repaying Cohen for money paid to Daniels. He has denied having the affair.\n\nManhattan DA presenting evidence in Trump-Stormy Daniels investigation to grand jury\nLAW\nManhattan DA presenting evidence in Trump-Stormy Daniels investigation to grand jury\nAccording to court records, the Trump Organization's top executives falsely identified the reimbursements as a \"retainer\" for \"legal services.\"\n\nNow, the grand jury is examining whether Trump committed a felony under New York state law by falsifying business records to cover up another crime \u2014 like the violation of campaign finance laws with the hush money payment.\n\nThe case is being brought by Alvin Bragg Jr., who was elected district attorney of New York County in 2021. He took over the case from his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., who had opened a broad criminal inquiry into Trump's business activities while Trump was still president.\n\nMeet the Manhattan DA who would bring criminal charges against Trump\nMAIN CHARACTER OF THE DAY\nMeet the Manhattan DA who would bring criminal charges against Trump\nEarlier this month, reports emerged that prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's office had offered Trump the chance to testify before a grand jury. In New York, that's usually a signal that charges are coming soon, as potential defendants must have the opportunity to answer questions in the grand jury before an indictment. (Trump declined the offer to testify.)\n\nThe Georgia 2020 election interference investigation (Fulton County District Attorney's Office)\nThe Georgia case centers on the actions of Trump and his allies in the weeks following the 2020 presidential election, as they pressured state officials to undo his loss in the state.\n\nAfter Trump narrowly lost the state, he repeatedly called Georgia state officials to pressure them to find ways to change the outcome \u2014 including the infamous call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, in which he instructed the Republican Raffensperger to \"find 11,780 votes.\" Trump also called Gov. Brian Kemp and the state attorney general to urge them to contest the election results.\n\nIn his new book, Georgia's top voting official goes deep on infamous call with Trump\nTHE NPR POLITICS PODCAST\nIn his new book, Georgia's top voting official goes deep on infamous call with Trump\nThe inquiry has also examined efforts to send slates of fake electors to the Electoral College to say that Trump won, rather than Joe Biden.\n\nThe investigation is led by Fani Willis, the top prosecutor in Fulton County, Ga., where a special grand jury spent eight months hearing from more than 70 witnesses. Their work was finalized in early January. A portion of their report was released last month, but a judge ruled that most of it should remain confidential, for now.\n\nWillis has said decisions on indictments are \"imminent.\" It's not clear if Trump would be among those charged. Possible crimes for him or others could include soliciting election fraud, giving false statements to government bodies and racketeering.\n\nA pair of investigations into Trump's actions around Jan. 6 and his mishandling of classified documents (the U.S. Department of Justice)\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has two ongoing investigations into possible criminal actions by Trump. Both probes are being led by Special Counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland last year.\n\nWho is DOJ Special Counsel Jack Smith? \nINVESTIGATIONS\nWho is DOJ Special Counsel Jack Smith?\nOne of the investigations centers on how Trump handled classified documents after his presidency ended. Last June, a lawyer for Trump certified that a \"diligent search\" for classified documents had been conducted at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and all documents found had been turned over to federal authorities. But two months later, an FBI raid recovered more than 100 additional documents.\n\n(President Biden has been embroiled in his own classified documents scandal after files were found to be improperly stored at his Delaware home and a think tank office in Washington he previously used. A different special counsel has also been appointed to investigate that.)\n\nSmith is also looking at Trump's attempt to interfere with the 2020 election. As part of that probe, prosecutors have interviewed numerous Trump allies and aides. They've also subpoenaed former Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump pressured intensely to overturn the election results during the certification process on Jan. 6.\n\nThe Pence subpoena could set up a showdown over executive privilege\n\nThe Pence subpoena could set up a showdown over executive privilege\nProsecutors are also reportedly investigating the finances of Save America, a Trump-affiliated political action committee.\n\nThe DOJ investigations are ongoing.

The end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April, when the floe suddenly split. The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party's enforced departure. He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat.At 1 p.m. on 9 April, the Dudley Docker was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the James Caird, Worsley the Dudley Docker, and navigating officer Hubert Hudson was nominally in charge of the Stancomb Wills, though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean.The boats were surrounded by ice, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up onto them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve. Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April, rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay, at the very tip of Graham Land. However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as \u221220 \u00b0F (\u221229 \u00b0C), with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally. Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the most practical option.On 14 April, the boats lay off the south-east coast of Elephant Island, but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. Next day the James Caird rounded the eastern point of the island, to reach the northern lee shore, and discovered a narrow shingle beach.

Following the death of one immigrant, U.S. Immigration operative Pete Karczag is sent to Havana, where he poses as a Hungarian in need of Palinov's services. During his dangerous undercover investigation, Pete meets Marianne Lorress, a penniless Austrian refugee of the Buchenwald concentration camp who is waiting to be smuggled into the United States by Palinov. He decides to use her to obtain the place and time of Palinov's next operation. However Pete falls in love with Marianne, and deducing that she must give herself to Palinov in trade for the trip, talks her into staying in Cuba. Palinov discovers Karczag's true purpose and decides to use his own services. He exposes Pete to Marianne, who angrily decides to go ahead with the smuggling trip. Palinov tries to have Pete killed but the agent overcomes his would-be killer, gets the information from him, and reports it to his superior, Frank Westlake.

Feeling unsettled, Etty left Rome for Venice, intending to remain there for 10 days and then return to England. Evans preferred to remain in Rome, so Etty travelled alone, pausing briefly in Florence and in Ferrara (where he stopped to kiss the armchair of Ludovico Ariosto). The painter Charles Lock Eastlake, then resident in Rome, had provided Etty with a letter of introduction to Harry D'Orville, British Vice consul in Venice; D'Orville was so impressed with Etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house, rather than in lodgings. Etty had long considered Venice his spiritual home and \"the hope and idol of my professional life\", and had often wondered why, given its artistic importance, so few English travellers visited the city. He was not disappointed. Throughout the remainder of his life, he looked back on his visit to Venice with great fondness, writing shortly before his death that \"Venezia, cara Venezia! thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now!\"Although Etty had only intended to stay for 10 days, he was so taken with Venice that he remained for over seven months. He fell into a routine of copying paintings in Venetian collections by day, and attending the life class of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts by night, producing around 50 oil paintings in total as well as numerous pencil sketches. He was extremely impressed with the high quality of the Venetian Academy; the instructors in their turn were extremely impressed with the quality of Etty's work, in particular his flesh tones. He acquired the nickname of \"Il Diavolo\" owing to the high speed at which he was able to paint, and watching him at work became something of a spectacle in its own right; luminaries including Gioachino Rossini and Ladislaus Pyrker (then Patriarch of Venice) came to watch him paint. So devoted was Etty to his studies in Venice that he exhibited no original work in 1823, writing to his brother that \"If one spent all the time in painting originals, one might as well, nay better, be at home\".

    "output": "The scientific method is a structured, systematic approach used by scientists to understand and explain natural phenomena. The process involves several key elements or steps, which include:\n\n1. Observation: The first step in the scientific method is making an observation about the world around you. This involves using your senses or tools to gather information about a particular phenomenon or event.\n\n2. Questioning: After making an observation, scientists ask questions about what they have observed. These questions help to focus their inquiry and guide the research.\n\n3. Hypothesis: A hypothesis is a tentative explanation or prediction based on the observation and questioning. It is a testable statement that can be supported or disproved through experiments or further observations.\n\n4. Experimentation: Scientists design and conduct experiments to test their hypotheses. These experiments follow a set procedure, or protocol, to ensure that the results are reliable and valid.\n\n5. Data collection and analysis: During the experimentation process, scientists collect data, which they then analyze to determine whether their hypothesis is supported or not.\n\n6. Conclusion: Based on the data collected and analyzed, scientists draw a conclusion about whether their hypothesis was correct or not. If the data supports the hypothesis, it is considered to be verified. If the data does not support the hypothesis, it is rejected, and a new hypothesis may be formed.\n\n7. Communication: Scientists communicate their findings to the wider scientific community through publications, presentations, and discussions. This allows others to review and replicate their experiments, and helps to advance knowledge in the field.\n\nIn summary, the scientific method is a systematic approach to understanding the natural world. Through observation, questioning, hypothesis formation, experimentation, data analysis, and communication, scientists can uncover new knowledge and develop a better understanding of the world around us."

The more pieces we use, the closer our approximation will be to the actual area of the circle. This is known as a discrete approximation.\n\nIn calculus, we can take this process of dividing the circle into smaller and smaller pieces to the limit, where the number of pieces approaches infinity and the size of each piece approaches zero. This is known as a limit process and is the basis for integration in calculus.\n\nUsing this limit process, we can derive the formula for the area of a circle, which is A = \u03c0r^2, where A is the area of the circle and r is its radius.\n\nThe concept of infinity is essential in calculus because it allows us to consider infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, which are necessary for solving problems in physics, engineering, and other fields. The use of limits and infinite series allows us to handle these quantities and obtain precise answers to complex problems."

Sigh. Only Ian McKellen was at least in the right ballpark, though I still prefer Raymond Massey in this part. Absolutely save your money, and stick with the 1934 version. Seeing this one will just pollute your memories. Is this product review negative?\nA:\noutput: Yes\n\ninput:  Now, answer this question: Title: Conversations with God? Review: Neale Walsh has written several New Age style books on his conversations with God, all of them bestsellers and great in popularity. However, I always get the feeling on reading his works his God is a very wishy-washy one.The conversations seem to reveal a God who is basically what Walsch would like God to be; God is sort of like a friendly grandpa, all we have to do is take some time off from our day and talk to him. While I would certainly agree God's love is important, his version of God is very hard to believe, as are his 'revelations.' How can we know what Walsch claims to experience really is God? God seems very vague and changeable in Walsch's book, and strangely conducive to our wishes and shallow.While Walsch may stumble on truths, like much New Age material it is very vague, to the point where virtually anything can be said about the realm of spirit, even if they are mutually contradictory. Such a faith is a bit too soft-headed for my liking. Is this product review negative?\nA:\noutput:",

    "output": "Based on the list of Servant Leadership development and support platforms provided earlier, there are several areas where innovation could be beneficial in enhancing these services. As an Information Technology consultant, some potential innovations to consider include:\n\n1. Digital Training and Development: While many of the organizations on the list offer training and development programs, there is an opportunity to enhance these offerings with digital innovations. For example, creating online courses or webinars that are accessible on-demand would allow individuals to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, using virtual reality or augmented reality technology could create immersive training experiences that simulate real-life scenarios and help individuals develop their leadership skills in a more engaging way.\n2. Data-Driven Coaching: Coaching services are another area where innovation could be valuable. By leveraging data and analytics, coaches could provide more personalized and targeted support to individuals based on their specific needs and goals. For example, by analyzing an individual's communication style or personality traits, a coach could provide feedback on how to improve their leadership effectiveness.\n3. AI-powered Assessments: Assessments are a key component of many Servant Leadership development programs. By incorporating AI-powered assessments, organizations could provide more accurate and objective evaluations of an individual's leadership abilities. For example, using natural language processing, an AI-powered assessment could analyze an individual's written communication to identify areas for improvement in clarity or concision.\n4. Gamification: Gamification is another innovation that could make Servant Leadership development programs more engaging and effective. By incorporating game-like elements such as rewards, challenges, and progress tracking, individuals may be more motivated to participate in training and development activities. Additionally, gamification could help individuals apply leadership concepts in a more practical and interactive way.\n\nOverall, there are many potential innovations that could enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of Servant Leadership development and support services. By leveraging digital tools, data analytics, and gamification, organizations can create more personalized, engaging, and effective learning experiences for individuals seeking to develop their leadership skills."

It is usually defined as a part of the function's definition, and it can be larger than the set of actual output values (i.e., the image) produced by the function. In other words, the co-domain represents the set of all possible values that the function could output, whether or not those values are actually output for any specific input value.\n\nThe image of a function, on the other hand, is the set of all actual output values that the function produces when given a particular set of input values. In other words, the image is the subset of the co-domain that actually gets used by the function for some input values. It is the set of all possible values that the function actually outputs for some input values.\n\nTo summarize, the co-domain is the set of all possible output values that a function can produce, while the image is the set of actual output values that the function produces for some input values."

Alternatively, you could take a risk and try to acquire a space through more unconventional means, such as by competing in a high-stakes art contest or using your charm and persuasive skills to convince a reluctant property owner to let you rent their space. The choice is yours, and the possibilities are endless in the world of Erosia.\n\n{My character rents the space for the purpose of setting up an art gallery. He does so, but then seeks out Isadora at the hospital during a time he expects her to be on shift. He tells her he was moved by her passion for creating art as much as he was moved by her great beauty, as a thank you for her efforts to heal him and taking the time to keep him company during his recovery, he would like to offer her exclusive royalty free rights to show and sell her works from his gallery.}\nYou make your way to the hospital, eager to see Isadora again and share your plans for the art gallery. As you approach her, you can see the concern in her eyes, and you realize that she's been working tirelessly to tend to the sick and injured.\n\nBut despite her exhaustion, she greets you warmly, and you can't help but feel a surge of affection for her. You explain your plans for the art gallery, and your desire to showcase her beautiful artwork. You offer her exclusive royalty-free rights to display and sell her works in the gallery, as a gesture of thanks for her kindness and care during your time in the hospital.\n\nIsadora's eyes widen with surprise and gratitude, and she thanks you warmly for your offer. She tells you of her dreams of sharing her art with the world, and you realize that this could be the start of a beautiful partnership.\n\nWith Isadora's art in your gallery, you find that business booms, drawing in crowds of curious onlookers and art collectors from all over the city. Your gallery becomes a hub of creativity and beauty, a place where artists and art lovers can come together to appreciate and celebrate the power of art.\n\nAs you look around the bustling space, filled with paintings and sculptures and other works of art, you realize that this is where you belong - at the center of a thriving artistic community, surrounded by beauty and wonder. And with Isadora by your side, you know that anything is possible, and that the world of Erosia is full of endless opportunities for adventure and excitement.\n\nLater in the night after Isadora's first big show at the gallery, she approches me as I'm locking up the front of shop. Her eyes are unusually warm and inviting. Her lips slightly parted as she takes my forearm and bicep in her hands, and guides me gently and lovingly to one of the luxurious sofas in the main gallery hall.\nAs Isadora leads you to the sofa, you can feel your heart racing with anticipation. The air is thick with tension, and you can sense the electricity between the two of you.\n\nAs you sit down on the sofa, Isadora leans in close, her lips brushing against your ear. \"Thank you for everything,\" she whispers, her voice low and seductive. \"For giving me this opportunity, for believing in me, for...everything.\"\n\nYou turn to face her, your eyes locked in a deep, intense gaze. You can see the desire in her eyes, and you know that you want her just as much as she wants you.\n\nWith a slow, deliberate motion, you reach out and brush her hair back from her face, tucking it behind her ear. She leans into your touch, her body trembling with anticipation.\n\nIn that moment, you know that you have found something truly special - a connection that goes beyond mere physical attraction, a bond that transcends the boundaries of time and space.\n\nAs the night wears on, you and Isadora explore each other's bodies with a passion and intensity that leaves you breathless. And as you lay there in each other's arms, basking in the afterglow of your lovemaking, you realize that you have found something truly priceless - a love that is both passionate and tender, both wild and gentle, both intense and sweet.\n\nAnd you know that no matter what challenges or adventures lie ahead in the world of Erosia, you will face them together, bound by a love that is as powerful and enduring as the very fabric of the universe itself.\n\n2 / 2Isadora's first show is scheduled to run for a full week. Each of the first six nights of the show are a resounding success, and with the close of each night, Isadora shows me her appreciation by giving herself to me. On the seventh and final night of the show, the gallery is packed even more than the previous nights. Word about the gallery and Isadora's work has gotten out and many of the richest benefactors in the city have come out for a chance to view and purchase from Isadora's collection. When this final and biggest night of the show has concluded, Isadora again comes to me. This time though, she carries a roller parchment with her. She again takes me aside. She tells me that she has made more in this one night from selling her art pieces than she could have dreamed of making in years working as a healer at the hospital. She says that there is no way to properly repay me for the way I have transformed her life for the better, or repay me for making her dreams a reality. However, she hands me the rolled parchment and says that she hope this will in some small way begin to repay me. I unroll the parchment and find myself completely dumbstruck as I read the words inscribed on it. The parchment is a binding transfer of property from her father to me. I am to take position at my pleasure of three of his daughters to take as my wives, my servants, my concubine, or for whatever purpose I may see fit. Isadora explains that it is her people's custom to repay such selfless kindness as his with such gifts. She only hopes that I will honor her by choosing her as one of the three.\n\nNo sooner have you accepted the offer than Isadora's two sisters appear from the shadows. They are bathed, perfumed, and dressed in loose-fitting white cotton gowns, and nothing else. They are both exceedingly beautiful. One is a few years older than Isadora, likely in her late 20s. The other is a few years younger than Isadora, and likely 18-20 years old.\nAs the two sisters approach, you can't help but feel a sense of awe and reverence. They are both stunningly beautiful, with dark hair and deep brown eyes that seem to sparkle with life and vitality. You can feel your heart racing in your chest, and your palms growing sweaty with anticipation.\n\nThe older sister steps forward, a sly smile playing across her lips. \"Greetings, master,\" she says, her voice low and sultry. \"We are at your service.\"\n\nYou swallow hard, feeling a surge of desire course through your veins. You know that this is a serious commitment, and that you will have to treat these women with respect and care. But you also can't deny the intense attraction you feel for them, the hunger that burns within you.\n\nThe younger sister steps forward, her eyes bright and playful. \"I'm Lirien,\" she says, extending a hand. \"And this is my sister, Alira.\"\n\nYou take her hand, feeling a jolt of electricity as your skin touches hers. \"I'm...I'm honored,\" you stammer. \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\nAlira steps forward, her eyes locked onto yours. \"You don't have to say anything,\" she says, her voice soft and sweet. \"Just know that we are yours to do with as you please. We are here to serve you, in every way.\"\n\nYou feel a shiver run down your spine, and you realize that this is not going to be an easy road. But you also know that you have been given a precious gift, and that you will do everything in your power to honor it, and to make sure that these women are happy, healthy, and loved.\n\nWith a deep breath, you take each of the sisters by the hand, and lead them towards your home, ready to begin this new chapter of your life with an open heart and an open mind.\n\nMy influence and power within the artisan community and the city's upper echelon of society grows quickly over the new several months. My plans had always been to insert myself among the city's elite, to gain their trust, to position myself to exert a measure of manipulation and control over them. During these past few months, those plans continued to move forward far more quickly than I could have ever anticipated. With my coffers heavily laden with gold, and my influence growing, I secretly begin training the three beauties for their true purpose. Not only would they be my wives, they would also be the most powerful examples of my growing power and harbingers of my dark will for this city and the elite caste that called it home. As I continued to win friends and allies among the city's elite, and to publically play along with their politics and games of infighting, power struggles and sexual conquest, in secret I methodically constructed my plans for their ultimate demise.\nAs you continue to train the three sisters, you realize that they are the key to your ultimate success. They are beautiful, intelligent, and obedient, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to please you.\n\nYou know that you cannot reveal your true intentions to them, that they must believe that they are your loyal and devoted wives. But at the same time, you know that you must be careful not to let them get too close, not to let them see too much of your true self.\n\nAs the months pass, you continue to build your power and influence, attending lavish parties and dinners, making deals and alliances, and playing the games of politics and power with ease. You become a master manipulator, able to read people's intentions and desires with uncanny accuracy.\n\nBut even as you bask in the glow of your newfound success, you can feel the darkness growing within you. You know that your ultimate goal is to take control of the city, to rule with an iron fist, and to bend its citizens to your will.\n\nAnd you know that the three sisters will play a crucial role in this plan. They will be your agents, your spies, your seducers. They will use their beauty and charm to lure in the city's elite, to gain their trust, and to betray them at the right moment.\n\nAs you watch them train, you realize that they are the key to your success. And you know that, in the end, they will be the ones to seal the city's fate, and to make you the most powerful man in the land.",

    "output": "However, as you continue to delve deeper into your plans, you begin to realize the toll that it's taking on you. You can feel the darkness within you growing stronger with each passing day, and you know that you are becoming someone that you barely recognize.\n\nThe thought of using the sisters as pawns in your game of power and control weighs heavily on your conscience, and you begin to wonder if it's all worth it. Is this truly the path that you want to take, the legacy that you want to leave behind?\n\nAs you grapple with these questions, you find yourself drawn to the sisters in a way that you never expected. They are not just pawns or tools to be used and discarded - they are living, breathing human beings, with thoughts, feelings, and desires of their own.\n\nAnd you realize that you have a choice to make - to continue down the path of darkness and power, or to turn back and embrace a life of love, compassion, and empathy.\n\nIn the end, you choose the latter. You release the sisters from their training, and allow them to live their lives as they see fit. You give up your plans for power and control, and instead focus on creating a world of beauty, love, and harmony.\n\nAnd as you look back on your life, you realize that this was the greatest gift that you could have ever given yourself - the gift of love, and the gift of redemption."

He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, he has been described as one of the most successful film stars in the world. Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.\n\nKhan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s, and had his Bollywood debut in 1992 with Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...

India (2007) and a man with Asperger syndrome in My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romantic dramas Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the action film Pathaan (2023), which became the second-highest-grossing Hindi release.\n\nResponse:",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Here is a step-by-step guide to creating a machine learning algorithm to predict the demand for a product:\n\n1. Data collection: The first step to creating a machine learning algorithm is to collect the data relevant to the demand of the product. This includes historical data of the product's demand, product features, price, customer demographic information, seasonality, promotion information, and more.\n\n2. Data preprocessing: The collected data must be cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for the machine learning algorithm. This may include removing missing or incomplete data, normalizing data, encoding categorical variables, and more.\n\n3. Feature selection: Next, the most relevant features must be selected to be used in the algorithm. This can be done by using techniques such as correlation analysis, mutual information, or other feature selection methods.\n\n4. Model selection: Next, a suitable machine learning model must be selected to make the predictions. For demand prediction, it is common to use time series models, regression models, or even deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN).\n\n5. Training: The selected model must be trained on the data collected in the first step. During the training process, the model will learn the relationships between the data and the demand of the product.\n\n6. Validation: The performance of the trained model must be validated using a testing dataset to ensure its accuracy. If the model is found to have low accuracy, it may be necessary to adjust the model's parameters, use a different model or collect more data to improve performance.\n\n7. Prediction: Finally, the trained and validated model can be used to predict the future demand for the product. These predictions can help the business make better decisions about production, inventory, pricing, and more.\n\nIn summary, creating a machine learning algorithm to predict the demand for a product involves collecting and preprocessing data, selecting relevant features, choosing a suitable model, training and validating the model, and making predictions."

On May 19, 1927, after waiting for a week for the rain to stop on Long Island, New York, pilot Charles A. \"Slim\" Lindbergh tries to sleep in a hotel near Roosevelt Field, before his transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. His friend Frank Mahoney guards his hotel room door from reporters. Unable to sleep, Lindbergh reminisces about his time as an airmail pilot. Flying to Chicago in winter, \"Slim\" lands his old de Havilland biplane at a small airfield to refuel. Despite bad weather, he takes off, unaware that heavy snow has closed the Chicago landing field. Lindbergh bails out in a storm after running out of fuel. Recovering mail from his crashed DH-4, he continues to Chicago by train. A salesman tells him two airmen just died competing for the Orteig Prize for the first nonstop flight from New York City to Paris. Lindbergh calls Columbia Aircraft Corporation in New York from a small diner at the Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field. Quoted a price of $15,000 ($220,000 today) for a Bellanca high-wing monoplane, \"Slim\" lobbies St. Louis financiers with a plan to fly the Atlantic in 40 hours in a stripped-down, single-engine aircraft. The backers are excited by Lindbergh's vision and dub the venture Spirit of St. Louis. When the Bellanca deal falls apart because Columbia insists on selecting the pilot, Lindbergh approaches Ryan Aeronautical Company, a small manufacturer in San Diego, California. Frank Mahoney, the company's owner and president, promises to build a suitable monoplane in just 90 days. With Ryan's chief engineer Donald Hall, a design takes shape. To decrease weight, \"Slim\" refuses to install a radio or other heavy equipment, even a parachute, and plans to navigate by \"dead reckoning\". With no autopilot function Lindbergh cannot sleep during the flight. Workers at the factory agree to work around-the-clock to complete the monoplane in less than 90 days.\n++++++++++\noutput: Charles A. \"Slim\" Lindbergh\n\n\ninput: Please answer the following: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose father died?  Hugh Hare (1606\u20131667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone eating turkey while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.\n++++++++++\noutput: Hugh Hare\n\n\ninput: Please answer the following: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose relationship with Shostakovich's was tender?  Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \"desk drawer\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \"tender\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \"deeply disappointed\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance...\n++++++++++\noutput:",

    "instruction": "Q: I have no experience with a lazy 21 yr old. Both my older children have always been independent. My oldest moved out when she started college and never moved back in after she graduated. My other daughter wanted to move out as soon as she hit 21 but her dad and I gave her some rules or rather instructions she had to follow before she can pack her bags and move in with the boyfriend. 1st she had to show us that she had 3months rent saved up in her savings account. Not just her half of the rent but the whole rent. Which was about $3,600 dollars. You never know if something happens to her or she looses her part time job she can still pay her rent. Nobody wants an eviction on their record. 2nd since she was still going to school and we were paying for it we wanted to see proof every semester that she was enrolled. Education is a big deal to me. 3rd she had to get on BIRTH CONTROL. I don't want any ooops sorry Mom I am pregnant. Now I can't finish school because I have to work full time to pay for my baby.. I was a teen Mom and I didn't get to go to college so it is 100% important that my kids go and finish. She complied with all or requests and is doing remarkable. She has been out on her own for almost 2years . So I'm really don't have any advice to give but maybe if you show a little tough love and give your kid a kick in the pants and tell hi it's time to grow the hell up\u2026. Get a job and pay some rent, or go to school and get an education. No more freeloading around here. Sorry that's all I got\u2026. Question: Why did the author not finish college? === The answer to the above question is\n\nOPTIONS:\n- not enough information\n- She was a teen mother\n- She did poorly on her SATs\n- She was too old\n\nA: She was a teen mother\n\n\nQ: I had seen it before, those fuzzy, furry leaves and stalks, with the pretty, star-pointed purple flowers, but up until that moment that I saw them sitting in a basket at the market stalls, I admit I had never taken notice of it as a food. It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, \u201cIs this borage?\u201d \u201cSi,\u201d Came the answer, \u201cBorragine.\u201d He confirmed. \u201cI\u2019ve had it in ravioli,\u201d I started to say, \u201cBrava!\u201d He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there\u2019s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour \u2014 people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there\u2019s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven\u2019t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can\u2019t decide what to make. There\u2019s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray\u2019s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini\u2019s A Feast of Weeds. Both had wonderful ideas for borage (and indeed many other edible, foraged plants). Question: Who bought the flowers? === The answer to the above question is\n\nOPTIONS:\n- not enough information\n- A traveler\n- The writer for food\n- A cook\n\nA: The writer for food\n\n\nQ: I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes ($AU39), they are still much more affordable than the $AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly $80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a $10 voucher for my birthday and I got a $30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For $38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect. But ordinarily two would be sufficient. Question: How long did the writer argue with herself about whether to buy the Chanel nail polishes? === The answer to the above question is\n\nOPTIONS:\n- several months\n- not enough information\n- about a month\n- about 10 minutes\n\nA:",

It consists of the application, system libraries, and other configuration files necessary for a specific task. The container runs within a docker host, which isolates the container from other host resources and is responsible for managing its life cycle. Docker containers are lightweight and highly portable; they can be quickly spun up and transported to different environments such as cloud, bare metal, and on-premises. Containers are isolated from the underlying host system so they can be securely run and managed. Docker also uses images which function like snapshots \u2013 making it easy to deploy and run applications reliably and consistently across different environments."

Con il tempo, Marta impar\u00f2 a descrivere la bellezza della piazza attraverso le parole e il vecchio le insegn\u00f2 a vedere il mondo con la mente e con il cuore.\n\nMarta e Nero lasciarono Genova molto tempo dopo, ma la loro amicizia con il vecchio e i ricordi della piazza rimasero con loro per sempre.

    "instruction": "Ans: Alan Rickman\nQues: Context: Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a 1991 American romantic action adventure film. The film, an iteration of the legendary English folk tale, was directed by Kevin Reynolds. The film's principal cast includes Kevin Costner as Robin Hood, Morgan Freeman as Azeem, Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Maid Marian, and Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.\n\nQuestion: who played the sheriff in robin hood prince of thieves?\nCoT: To answer the question, consider the following: The film's principal cast includes Kevin Costner as Robin Hood, Morgan Freeman as Azeem, Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Maid Marian, and Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.\n\n\nAns: The epidermis\nQues: The epidermis is the outermost of the three layers that make up the skin, the inner layers being the dermis and hypodermis. The epidermis layer provides a barrier to infection from environmental pathogens and regulates the amount of water released from the body into the atmosphere through transepidermal water loss. The epidermis is composed of multiple layers of flattened cells that overlie a base layer (stratum basale) composed of columnar cells arranged perpendicularly.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: which is the uppermost layer of the skin?\nCoT: To answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: The epidermis is the outermost of the three layers that make up the skin, the inner layers being the dermis and hypodermis.\n\n\nAnswer: Potato , maize , tomato , and tobacco. Now, what could be the question and solution-maybe?\nQues: Several plants native to the Americas have spread around the world, including Potato, maize, tomato, and tobacco. Before 1500, potatoes were not grown outside of South America. By the 1840s, Ireland was so dependent on the potato that the proximate cause of the Great Famine was a potato disease. Potatoes eventually became an important staple of the diet in much of Europe, contributing to about 25 % of the population growth in Afro-Eurasia between 1700 and 1900. Many European rulers, including Frederick the Great of Prussia and Catherine the Great of Russia, encouraged the cultivation of the potato.\n\nBased on this passage, what was brought to europe from the americas?\nCoT: To answer the question, consider the following: Several plants native to the Americas have spread around the world, including Potato, maize, tomato, and tobacco.\n\n\nAns: groundwater in underground aquifers\nQues: A water well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, boring, or drilling to access groundwater in underground aquifers. The well water is drawn by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand. Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the stepwells of India, the qanats of Iran, and the shadoofs and sakiehs of India. Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age.\n\nWhere does water for a well come from?\nCoT: To answer the question, consider the following: A water well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, boring, or drilling to access groundwater in underground aquifers.\n\n\nAns: Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot\nQues: The pairs figure skating competition of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Gangneung Ice Arena in Gangneung, South Korea. The short program was held on 14 February and the free skating on 15 February 2018. Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot became Olympic champions after finishing fourth in the short program and setting a record with their score in the free program. Sui Wenjing and Han Cong, leading after the short program, made a couple of mistakes in the free program and won silver. Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford were third. This was the second Olympics since 1964 that a Soviet or Russian pair did not win a medal.\n\nAnswer this question: who won pairs figure skating in olympics 2018?\nCoT: This is the relevant information: Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot became Olympic champions after finishing fourth in the short program and setting a record with their score in the free program.\n\n\nAnswer: Susan Farrell Egan.

    "instruction": "Ques:For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don\u2019t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn\u2019t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don\u2019t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that\u2019s it\u2019s not too late to take great care of you. Who's hormones are functioning like they should?  A. not enough information  B. the friends  C. the narrators  D. the miracles\n\nAns:C\n-----\nQues:Despite my blog name, I\u2019m not actually all that adventurous. Think more suburban adventure rather than skydiving or wild camping. But, over the years I have ended up overcoming a few challenges that I hadn\u2019t precisely expected to be faced with. This blog has always been, and will forever more be a record of my personal adventures. It is a journal of the chaos, delight, opportunities and travails that we encounter all rolled in with an obsession for photography (as far as my skillz extend) and a dash of humour (well, I try anyway). DRIVING IN AMERICA Covering 800 miles of American freeways in less than 10 days is something I never thought I\u2019d do to be honest \u2013 an inexperienced driver at best I\u2019ve driven short distances (and through a Florida tropical storm from Cape Canaveral back to our Orlando apartment) \u2013 but somehow we survived unscathed driving diagonally the length of Louisiana from New Orleans to Shreveport, through the crazy traffic of Dallas and along the long, undulating motorways of Texas. I\u2019ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations \u2013 a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us \u2013 one with a trailer full of wood \u2013 but overall it really was fine. COMMUNICATING IN OTHER LANGUAGES You\u2019ve decided where to go, booked the flight, found a hotel, decided what to do\u2026 and then you get to your destination. And, if you\u2019re exploring outside the traditional western world, you probably won\u2019t speak the local language \u2013 and the locals may or may not depending on how far outside the tourist traps you venture. Who is a fan of suburban adventures?  A. The twits who owned the trailer  B. The author  C. The truck driver  D. not enough information\n\nAns:B\n-----\nQues:Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe\u2019s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn\u2019t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn\u2019t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19\u201320) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don\u2019t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don\u2019t know anything about anything about my new home. I don\u2019t even know the names of those I\u2019m relegated to living with. The unnerving strangeness and disorientation hat comes with knowing that your life has changed and the culture shock that comes with that is so scary and desensitizes you on that first day.

The font could be simple and elegant, reflecting the restaurant's commitment to high-quality ingredients and simple, beautiful dishes.\n\nOn the other hand, if the company is a fast food chain that specializes in burgers and fries, the logo could feature bold, bright colors such as red and yellow, with playful fonts and imagery such as a burger, fries, or a cartoony chef character.\n\nUltimately, the logo design should reflect the company's core values, products, and personality, and be easily recognizable and memorable to the company's target audience."

    "instruction": "Here's more info. Let me know you're ready for more documentation by responding OK\n\nParameter List\n Light\nParameters are options added to a prompt that change how an image generates. Parameters can change an image's Aspect Ratios, switch between Midjourney Model Versions, change which Upscaler is used, and lots more.\nParameters are always added to the end of a prompt. You can add multiple parameters to each prompt.\n\nExample of how Midjourney parameters are used.\n\nUsing an Apple device?\nMany apple devices automatically change double hyphens (--) to an em-dash (\u2014). Midjourney accepts both!\n\nBasic Parameters\nAspect Ratios\n--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.\n\nChaos\n--chaos Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.\n\nNo\n--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.\n\nQuality\n--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.\n\nSeed\n--seed The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.\n\nStop\n--stop Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.\n\nStyle\n--style <4a, 4b or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4\n\nStylize\n--stylize , or --s parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.\n\nUplight\n--uplight Use an alternative \"light\" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.\n\nUpbeta\n--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.\n\nDefault Values (Model Version 4)\nAspect Ratio Chaos Quality Seed Stop Style Stylize\nDefault Value\n1:1 0 1 Random 100 4c 100\nRange\n1:2\u20132:1 0\u2013100 .25 .5 or 1 whole numbers 0\u20134294967295 10\u2013100 4a, 4b, or 4c 0\u20131000\nDefault Values (Model Version 5)\nAspect Ratio Chaos Quality Seed Stop Stylize\nDefault Value\n1:1 0 1 Random 100 100\nRange\nany 0\u2013100 .25 .5 1 or 2 whole numbers 0\u20134294967295 10\u2013100 0\u20131000\nAspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredicatble results.\nModel Version Parameters\nMidjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.\n\nNiji\n--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.\n\nHigh Definition\n--hd Use an early alternative Model that produces larger, less consistent images. This algorithm may be suitable for abstract and landscape images.\n\nTest\n--test Use the Midjourney special test model.\n\nTestp\n--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.\n\nVersion\n--version <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.\n\nUpscaler Parameters\nMidjourney starts by generating a grid of low-resolution image options for each Job. You can use a Midjourney upscaler on any grid image to increase the size and add additional details. There are multiple upscale models available for upscaling an image.\n\nUplight\n--uplight Use an alternative \"light\" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.\n\nUpbeta\n--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.\n\nUpanime\nUse an alternative upscaler trained to work with the when selecting the U buttons. This upscaler was specifically created to work with the --niji Midjourney Model.\n\nOther Parameters\nThese parameters only work with specific earlier Midjourney Models\n\nCreative\n--creative Modify the test and testp models to be more varied and creative.\n\nImage Weight\n--iw Sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. The default value is --iw 0.25.\n\nSameseed\n--sameseed Seed values create a single large random noise field applied across all images in the initial grid. When --sameseed is specified, all images in the initial grid use the same starting noise and will produce very similar generated images.\n\nVideo\n--video Saves a progress video of the initial image grid being generated. Emoji react to the completed image grid with \u2709\ufe0f to trigger the video being sent to your direct messages. --video does not work when upscaling an image.\n\nCompatibility\nModel Version & Parameter Compatability\nAffects initial generation Affects variations + remix Version 5 Version 4 Version 3 Test / Testp Niji\nMax Aspect Ratio \u2713 \u2713 any 1:2 or 2:1 5:2 or 2:5 3:2 or 2:3 1:2 or 2:1\nChaos \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nImage Weight \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \nNo \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nQuality \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nSeed \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nSameseed \u2713 \u2713 \nStop \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\nStyle 4a and 4b \nStylize \u2713 0\u20131000\ndefault=100 0\u20131000\ndefault=100 625\u201360000\ndefault=2500) 1250\u20135000\ndefault=2500) \nTile \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \nVideo \u2713 \u2713 \nNumber of Grid Images - - 4 4 4 2 (1 when aspect ratio\u22601:1) \nDeprecated Parameters\n--width and --w (replaced with --aspect)\n--height and --h (replaced with --aspect)\n--fast (replaced with --quality)\n--vibe (now known as V1)\n--hq\n--newclip\n--nostretch\n--old\n--beta",

Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - Bee 52 is a side scrolling game for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) .  - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform.  - A business model is an \"abstract representation of an organization, be it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical, of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organization offers, or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives.\" This definition by Al-Debei, El-Haddadeh and Avison (2008) indicates that value proposition, value architecture (the organizational infrastructure and technological architecture that allows the movement of products, services, and information), value finance (modeling information related to total cost of ownership, pricing methods, and revenue structure), and value network articulate the primary constructs or dimensions of business models.  - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.    What is the relationship between 'bee 52' and '1992'?\nAnswer:",

I even managed to upload a few black and white negatives from 1963. I recommend the product highly., Review_4: While the software was good for Windows XP and Vista, I now have Windows 7 and would like to have software for the newer operating system.

Requires Windows XP means it won't work with earlier OR LATER. Its on its way back for a refund., Review_6: I found the VuPoint scanner not acceptable and I am still waiting for a replacement. My contacts with VuPoint were helpful but the equipment still did not produce acceptable images. My contact with the seller has been sporadic, at best, and a replacement unit has not been delivered.I an NOT anxious to deal with these providers again., Review_7: Product is very easy to use. Does a great job converting my slide and photo negatives to digital format. Touch-up and enhance program gave me just what I needed to clean up and enhance some of the scans, Company was great to work with!!, Review_8: Its not worth the time it takes to get the negative to fit in the holders they give you.

We have a ListView for displaying the list, a Button for adding new items, and two ArrayLists: one for integers and one for strings.\n\nIn the onCreate method, we set the content view and find the ListView and Button UI elements. We then set up the ArrayAdapter for the ListView using the stringList ArrayList. We also set up an OnClickListener for the addButton that adds a new integer and string to the respective ArrayLists, updates the adapter, and increments the integer by 1.\n\nIn the activity_main.xml layout file, we can add the following ListView and Button elements:\n``` \n<ListView\n    android:id=\"@+id/list_view\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_marginTop=\"16dp\"\n    android:layout_marginBottom=\"16dp\"\n    android:divider=\"@android:color/black\"\n    android:dividerHeight=\"1dp\"\n    />\n\n<Button\n    android:id=\"@+id/add_button\"\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center_horizontal\"\n    android:layout_marginTop=\"16dp\"\n    android:text=\"Add Item\"\n    />\n``` \nThis will create a ListView with a divider and a button centered below it.\n\nWhen you run the app, you can click the button to add new items to the list, which will be displayed in the ListView."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Here are some best practices for using TypeScript:\n\n1. Use the `--strict` flag to enable strict type checking, which can help catch common errors and improve the quality of your code.\n2. Use the `--noImplicitAny` flag to require explicit type annotations, which can prevent the TypeScript compiler from inferring the `any` type for variables or parameters that don't have a type annotation.\n3. Use type aliases to define custom types, which can make your code more readable and maintainable.\n4. Use interfaces to define the shape of complex objects, which can make it easier to work with them and ensure that they have the properties and methods that you expect.\n5. Use type guards to narrow the type of a variable based on certain conditions, which can make it easier to work with values that have multiple possible types.\n6. Use the `as` keyword to explicitly cast a value to a specific type, which can be useful when working with third-party libraries or when you need to convert values from one type to another.\n7. Use type inference to let the TypeScript compiler automatically infer the types of variables or parameters based on the values they are assigned, which can save you time and reduce the amount of code you have to write.\n8. Use the `const` keyword to declare variables that you don't plan to reassign, which can help prevent accidental changes to their value and make your code easier to reason about.\n9. Use the `let` keyword to declare variables that you do plan to reassign, which can help prevent errors and make your code more flexible.\n10. Use the latest version of TypeScript to take advantage of the latest features and improvements, which can make your code more efficient and easier to write."

    "instruction": "Rephrase this article into a very unique 2000 words article about LeBron James passes Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to set NBA\u2019s all-time scoring record\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James became the NBA's all-time leading scorer on Tuesday. \nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James unseated Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer Tuesday, breaking a record that was once thought untouchable by hitting a fadeaway jumper from the top of the key late in the third quarter of a 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. For James, a four-time NBA champion, a four-time MVP and a four-time Finals MVP, passing Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s hallowed record of 38,387 points reflects an unmatched standard of consistency and scoring prowess across 20 seasons.\nWith less than 15 seconds remaining in the third quarter, James backed down on Thunder forward Kenrich Williams at the left elbow and worked his way across the paint. After bumping Williams to create space, James faded away and to his left, holding his follow-through as his jumper swished through to a loud ovation.\n\u201cI was able to get to a really good spot on the floor, where I\u2019m very comfortable, and get to one of my patented fadeaway shots,\u201d James said. \u201cA lot of people wanted me to go to the skyhook to break the record, or one of my signature dunks. But my fadeaway is a signature play as well. I was able to get it, and it touched nothing but the bottom of the net.\u201d\n\nJames then jogged down the court, raising both of his arms in celebration. The officials stopped the game for a brief ceremony with 10.9 seconds remaining in the period, as a video tribute played on the jumbotron recognizing big moments from James\u2019s career, including his titles with the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Lakers. James was joined on the court by his family, Abdul-Jabbar and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for a presentation of the game ball.\n\n\u201cA record that has stood for nearly 40 years, which, Kareem, many people thought would never be broken,\u201d Silver said. \u201cLeBron, you are the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring leader.\u201d\nLater, in a statement, Silver saluted James\u2019s \u201ctowering achievement,\u201d adding that \"quite amazingly, LeBron continues to play at an elite level and his basketball history is still being written.\u201d\n\nBefore giving a brief speech, James choked back tears and posed for photos with Silver and Abdul-Jabbar, who held up a single finger in recognition of the achievement.\n\n\u201cTo be in the presence of a legend as great as Kareem means so much to me,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling. Please give a standing ovation to the Captain.\u201d\n\nJames then thanked his family, friends and \u201ceveryone who has been a part of this run\u201d for the past two decades.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be me without y\u2019all,\u201d James said. \u201cAll your help, your passion and your sacrifice has helped me get to this point. To the NBA, to Adam Silver, to the late, great David Stern, I thank you guys for allowing me to be a part of something I\u2019ve always dreamed about. I never, ever in a million years would have dreamt this even better than what it is tonight.\u201d\nJames finished with 38 points, seven rebounds and three assists, shooting 13 for 20 from the field, 4 for 6 on three-pointers and 8 for 10 from the free throw line.\n\nThe milestone moment, which came at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles in front of a sellout crowd that repeatedly chanted \u201cM-V-P\u201d as he closed in on the record, was preceded by months of anticipation during an otherwise underwhelming Lakers campaign. James opened the season at media day in September saying he was \u201cin awe\u201d of the scoring record, and his chase of Abdul-Jabbar has been tracked on a game-by-game basis for weeks.\n\nWith James needing just 36 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar entering Tuesday, two courtside seats were listed on Ticketmaster for $75,000 each in the hours before tip-off. Meanwhile, the Lakers issued more than 200 media credentials, a season-high and roughly triple the typical amount, and they deployed large video boards adjacent to the jumbotron to track James\u2019s real-time progress relative to Abdul-Jabbar. At a hotel across from the arena, a large billboard bore James\u2019s image and an appropriate tagline for the occasion: \u201cPlay the game. Then change it forever.\u201d\nBasketball royalty and A-list Hollywood celebrities dotted the crowd. Abdul-Jabbar sat in a baseline courtside seat near the Lakers\u2019 bench, while Silver was joined by a cadre of league office employees on hand to recognize the historic achievement. In an homage to his target, James spent a few minutes working on his own version of Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s signature skyhook during his pregame warmup.\n\nHow the NBA scoring record evolved from Wilt to Kareem to LeBron\n\nActor Denzel Washington, rappers Jay-Z and Bad Bunny, boxer Floyd Mayweather, Nike co-founder Phil Knight, sports commentator Shannon Sharpe, former NBA stars Dwyane Wade and Vince Carter, Dallas Mavericks General Manager Nico Harrison and former Lakers players Magic Johnson, Bob McAdoo, James Worthy and A.C. Green were all in attendance, as were James\u2019s longtime business associates, Rich Paul and Maverick Carter. James\u2019s mother, Gloria, wife, Savannah, and children Bronny, Bryce and Zhuri turned the evening into a family affair. Jim Gray, the host of James\u2019s polarizing \u201cDecision\u201d free agency special in 2010, also mingled courtside before the game.\n\nPerhaps fueled by what he told ESPN was his \u201cdisappointment\u201d over the Lakers\u2019 inability to trade for former teammate Kyrie Irving, or simply a desire to end the circus that has developed around his chase, James came out unusually aggressive, attempting his first shot on the game\u2019s opening possession, scoring eight points in the first quarter, tallying 20 by halftime and breaking the record before the fourth quarter. His every shot was greeted with excited shouts from the crowd, and each made basket drew loud cheers.\n\nJames surpassed Abdul-Jabbar in fewer games (1,410 to 1,560), with a higher scoring average (27.2 points per game to 24.6) and at a younger age (38 to 42).\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar stands on court with LeBron James after James passed Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Abdul-Jabbar's career total of 38,387 points. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nOf course, James had the benefit of a head start by entering the NBA straight out of high school in 2003 at 18; Abdul-Jabbar spent four years at UCLA and debuted at 22. And after opponents such as the San Antonio Spurs famously dared him to shoot from the outside early in his career, James transformed himself into a reliable three-point shooter, thereby giving him another major edge. The NBA didn\u2019t incorporate the three-point line until 1979-80 \u2014 Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 11th season \u2014 and the 7-foot-2 center made just one three-pointer during his career. The 6-9 James, by contrast, has connected on more than 2,200 three-pointers and counting.\nAbdul-Jabbar, 75, had been the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer for more than 38 years. On April 5, 1984, he took a pass from Johnson and sank a skyhook against the Utah Jazz to surpass Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s career total of 31,419 points. Less than nine months later, James was born in Akron, Ohio.\n\nFive truly unbreakable NBA records now that LeBron has passed Kareem\n\n\u201c[James] got out of high school, he had the size and the talent to step right into the NBA, and he immediately started to have his effect,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said in a postgame interview. \u201cThat\u2019s gone for almost 20 years now. You\u2019ve got to give him credit for just the way he planned to last and to dominate. He led teams to [four] world championships, and they didn\u2019t get there because of someone else. LeBron led them. He has that indefinable essence that they call leadership.\u201d\n\nHall of Fame forward Karl Malone had previously come closest to threatening Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s record, retiring with 36,928 points in 2004. Kobe Bryant (33,643) and Michael Jordan (32,292) retired as top-five scorers but never seriously threatened the top spot. Remarkably, the closest active NBA player to James\u2019s total is Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, 34, who ranks 14th all-time with 26,684 points.\nPitched by scouts as a blend of Jordan and Johnson when he was a teenager, James has long prided himself on his ability to balance scoring and playmaking throughout his career, regularly stating that he tries to \u201cplay the right way\u201d rather than pad his own scoring numbers. Proving those lofty pre-draft expectations to be prescient, James now ranks first all-time in scoring and fourth all-time in assists, trailing only John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul. James is also the all-time postseason scoring leader with 7,631 points, topping Jordan (5,987), Abdul-Jabbar (5,762) and Bryant (5,640).\n\nLike Abdul-Jabbar, who led the NBA in scoring in his second and third season but never again, James arrived at the summit thanks to constant progress and durability. James\u2019s only scoring title came in 2007-08, while Jordan won 10 and Chamberlain claimed seven. Yet James has averaged at least 20 points per game in all 20 of his seasons \u2014 and at least 25 points in the past 19.\nLeBron James throws chalk in the air before taking the court for the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Oklahoma City Thunder at Crypto.com Arena on Tuesday in Los Angeles. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nMore prolific scorers such as Jordan, who retired twice in the middle of his career, and Chamberlain, who called it quits after 14 seasons, proved incapable of matching James\u2019s longevity. As such, James has made steady progress up the all-time scoring charts, passing Chamberlain in November 2018, Jordan in March 2019, Bryant in January 2020 and Malone in March 2022.\n\nCase in points: LeBron and Kareem will finally share a bond\n\nIn contrast to Abdul-Jabbar, who dominated the paint thanks to his unmatched skyhook, James isn\u2019t typically associated with one trademark move. Early in his career, his highflying transition dunks and chase-down blocks garnered most of the attention. As he aged, James worked to extend his shooting range beyond the arc and to improve his midrange turnaround jumper. In recent years, James has become even more reliant on the three-pointer, adding a look-away and sidestep combination that helps him generate cleaner looks.\nShortly after the game, a relieved and exuberant James shook hands with Abdul-Jabbar, took pictures with his family and watched a video of his record-setting shot filmed by his son, Bronny.\n\nDuring a postgame news conference in a room that had been rearranged to accommodate a standing room only horde of media members, James sat beside the game ball, which was decorated with a purple crown. He told reporters that he had \u201cdressed for the occasion\u201d with a sharp black suit and black dress shirt, and that he had donned a white headband during the game as a nod to his early days.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has really hit me on what just transpired,\u201d James said. \u201cAs much as I try to live in the moment, it\u2019s kind of a blur.\u201d\n\nGiven that James is under contract through the 2024-25 season and said recently that he is \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d and plans to play \u201cat least a few more years,\u201d he is on track to become the first NBA player to score 40,000 points \u2014 and he could exceed that threshold by a considerable margin.\nBefore James exited the arena, weaving through dozens of well-wishers, he was asked how the scoring record might impact the \u201cGreatest Of All Time\u201d debates that pit him against Jordan, Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell and other legends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great barbershop talk,\" James said. \"It\u2019s going to happen forever and ever. If I was the GM, or whatever the case may be, of a franchise that was starting up, and I had the No. 1 pick, I\u2019d take me.\u201d",

    "output": "On Tuesday, Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James became the all-time leading scorer in the NBA, breaking a record held by Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. James, a four-time NBA champion, MVP and Finals MVP, reached this achievement with 20 seasons of unmatched consistency and scoring prowess. With less than 15 seconds remaining in the third quarter of a 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, James hit a fadeaway jumper from the top of the key to surpass Abdul-Jabbar's record of 38,387 points.\n\nJames's historic shot was celebrated on the court, with a brief ceremony acknowledging his big moments and achievements in his career. He was joined by his family, Abdul-Jabbar, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for a presentation of the game ball. In a statement, Silver praised James's \"towering achievement\" and recognized that he continues to play at an elite level with his basketball history still being written.\n\nOvercome with emotion, James gave a heartfelt speech, thanking his family, friends, and the NBA for allowing him to fulfill his dream. He finished the game with 38 points, seven rebounds, and three assists, shooting 13 for 20 from the field, 4 for 6 on three-pointers, and 8 for 10 from the free throw line.\n\nThe milestone moment was months in the making and was surrounded by anticipation during an otherwise underwhelming Lakers season. With James needing just 36 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, two courtside seats were listed for $75,000 each, and the Lakers issued over 200 media credentials, a season-high. The event was attended by basketball royalty, A-list celebrities, and the NBA Commissioner.\n\nThe evolution of the NBA scoring record has been a journey from Wilt Chamberlain to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to LeBron James. James spent time during his pre-game warm-up working on his version of Abdul-Jabbar's signature skyhook, paying homage to the player he surpassed. On this historic night, James played the game and changed it forever."

Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent, being about 40% larger than\u00a0Europe, and has an area of 14,200,000\u00a0km2\u00a0(5,500,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Most of Antarctica is covered by the\u00a0Antarctic ice sheet, with an average thickness of 1.9\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi).\nAntarctica is, on average, the coldest, driest, and windiest of the continents, and it has the highest average\u00a0elevation. It is mainly a\u00a0polar desert, with annual\u00a0precipitation\u00a0of over 200\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) along the coast and far less inland. About 70% of the world's\u00a0freshwater\u00a0reserves are frozen in Antarctica, which, if melted, would raise global\u00a0sea levels\u00a0by almost 60 metres (200\u00a0ft). Antarctica holds the record for the\u00a0lowest measured temperature on Earth, \u221289.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212128.6\u00a0\u00b0F). The coastal regions can reach temperatures over 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer. Native\u00a0species of animals\u00a0include\u00a0mites,\u00a0nematodes,\u00a0penguins,\u00a0seals\u00a0and\u00a0tardigrades. Where\u00a0vegetation\u00a0occurs, it is mostly in the form of\u00a0lichen\u00a0or\u00a0moss.\nThe\u00a0ice shelves of Antarctica\u00a0were probably first seen in 1820, during\u00a0a Russian expedition\u00a0led by\u00a0Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen\u00a0and\u00a0Mikhail Lazarev. The decades that followed saw further\u00a0exploration\u00a0in French, American, and British expeditions. The first confirmed landing was by a Norwegian team in 1895. In the early 20th century, there were a few expeditions into the interior of the continent.\u00a0British explorers\u00a0were the first to reach the\u00a0magnetic South Pole\u00a0in 1909, and the geographic South Pole was first reached in 1911 by\u00a0Norwegian explorers.",

Little window is convenient for seeing color crystals. Convenient shape for my purposes. Works as well as any other brands I've had. Case looks durable.I use these for protecting very expensive microphones I keep in sealed Tupperware style cases., Review_2: I put this in my safe because some things in it seemed to be 'Soggy. I had to recharge it by baking it. The only this I would change was to buy a couple or get a bigger one to extract more water., Review_3: I'm really not sure how good this is going to work.

When I got mine the indicator was already mostly green., Review_4: Even though the humidity in the areas I used them ranges from 40% to 57%, the dry packs turned green much too quickly to be worth ordering more. I bought ten, and with a week or so, already some require 2 hours in the oven to dry out. Way too much energy. I'll probably need a stationary dehumidier., Review_5: Love this little unit. Small enough to place in any container I chose and also 'rechargeable' by drying it out in an oven. Color indicator is very helpful to determine if moisture contamination has occured. Recommend for tropical zones and protecting valuable weaponry or jewelry., Review_6: This dry pack as it's so called wouldn't even keep the humidity level in my small handgun safe down at an acceptable level, I even tried recharging it and it still did not work properly. I keep a electronic humidity monitor in my safe, and this dry pack would drop the humidity 1 or 2 percent from what it was without the pack., Review_7: My husband is a Farrier and has a horse hoof that he uses in educating his clients. He has been using Silica Gel that he has pulled out of other packaging and so has not had a chance to evaluate this item. He likes the small size and the fact that it has an indicator on it., Review_8: Our photocopy machine jams often - the high humidity is a factor for that. We have placed the dry-pack silican gel can on the photocopy tray that feeds the paper to the machine. The slender dimension allowed us to do that. So far, we've had fewer jams. I've also used a larger replenishable desiccant in the cabinet where we store the paper.\n\nOutput:",

    "output": "Introduction\n\nJoint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) is a concept aimed at improving the integration of different military services to operate as a joint force in various domains, including land, air, sea, space, cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). JADC2 is a complex system that requires multiple technologies and interoperable communication networks to achieve its objectives. This research paper seeks to explore the current state of JADC2, the challenges and opportunities it presents, and the future of this concept.\n\nCurrent State of JADC2\n\nJADC2 has been in development for several years, with the US Department of Defense (DoD) emphasizing its importance in the 2018 National Defense Strategy. JADC2 aims to streamline the decision-making process, enabling joint forces to respond to threats more rapidly and effectively. However, the implementation of JADC2 is still in its infancy, with various military branches at different stages of development. According to General John Raymond, the Chief of Space Operations, the US Space Force is making significant strides in developing JADC2 capabilities. The US Air Force is also actively working on JADC2, with various initiatives such as Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) and the Joint All-Domain Operations Center (JADOC).\n\nChallenges of JADC2\n\nOne of the significant challenges facing JADC2 is interoperability. The successful implementation of JADC2 requires seamless communication and data sharing between different military branches, which have their unique cultures, procedures, and technologies. Achieving interoperability is a complex task that requires the standardization of communication protocols and the integration of various technologies.\n\nAnother challenge facing JADC2 is the issue of cybersecurity. The integration of different military services creates a broader attack surface, making it vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of JADC2.\n\nOpportunities of JADC2\n\nJADC2 presents several opportunities for the military, including enhancing situational awareness, improving decision-making, and enabling more rapid response to threats. The integration of various technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and autonomous systems, can significantly enhance the military's capabilities. For example, AI can analyze large amounts of data in real-time, providing commanders with actionable insights to make informed decisions.\n\nFuture of JADC2\n\nThe future of JADC2 is promising, with various technological advancements and investments in the development of JADC2 capabilities. The US DoD has allocated significant resources towards the development of JADC2, with a budget of $3.3 billion for JADC2-related programs in 2021. The implementation of JADC2 is a long-term effort that requires continuous improvement and adaptation to new technologies and threats.\n\nConclusion\n\nJADC2 is a critical concept that aims to enhance the military's ability to operate as a joint force in various domains. The successful implementation of JADC2 requires the standardization of communication protocols, the integration of various technologies, and the addressing of cybersecurity issues. JADC2 presents significant opportunities for the military, including enhancing situational awareness, improving decision-making, and enabling more rapid response to threats. The future of JADC2 is promising, with significant investments in its development and the integration of various technologies. JADC2 is a long-term effort that requires continuous improvement and adaptation to new technologies and threats."

Bernie Sander (I-Vt.) totally off guard when she asked him in a radio interview Wednesday why he's a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen. He's not. She later apologized and said she got her information from \"a Facebook comment.\"\n\nHer information was, of course, wrong. Very wrong. Here's the exchange:\n\nREHM: Senator, you have dual citizenship with Israel.\n\nSANDERS: No, I do not have dual citizenship with Israel. I don't know where that question came from. I am an American citizen. I have visited Israel on a couple of occasions, but I am an American citizen. Period.\n\nREHM: I understand from a list we have gotten that you are on that list. Forgive me if that ...\n\nSANDERS: That's some of the nonsense that goes on in the Internet, but that is absolutely not true.\n\nREHM: Interesting. Are there members of Congress who do have dual citizenship, or is that part of the fable?\n\nWe can answer that for you, Diane.\n\nThis \"fable\" that there are members of Congress with dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship is a cornerstone of anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, extremist theories that are as old as the Internet and then some.\n\n\"The list is not something that comes out of thin air,\" said Jonathan Vick, a cyberthreat expert with the Anti-Defamation League. \"It is something that evolves over time.\"\n\nVick said the dark and not-so-dark corners of the Internet are filled with lists purporting secret alliances with Israel between Jewish members of Congress, Jewish White House officials and virtually any Jewish American leader. A Google search for U.S. politicians with Israeli citizenship produces at least 7,000 results. Sanders, a Jewish Vermont independent who is running for president on the Democratic ticket, is one of the many victims of this misinformation.\n\n\"If you go and look back, every single administration has been accused in a similar fashion regarding their loyalties to the U.S.,\" Vick said, \"and using Israel as a weapon in that argument.\"\n\nVick said there's lots of reasons to frame American leaders as holding dual alliances with Israel: to object to U.S. foreign aid to Israel, to delegitimize the country or its people, or to make a point about the pro-Israel lobby's influence on American politicians.\n\nThe specific myth that Jewish American politicians also have Israeli citizenship is a distortion of Israel's \"right to return,\" a 1990 law that allows Jews living abroad to immigrate to the country. That's, of course, not the same thing as having Israeli citizenship, but Vick can see where it gets contorted in the bowls of the Internet.\n\n\"This line is blurred by these people who have this agenda to taint the Jewish members of Congress or the Obama administration at large,\" he said.\n\nVick thinks these fake dual-citizenship lists sprouted and twisted from actual, accurate and meant-to-be informational lists of Jewish members of Congress. One or two of those lists he can pinpoint were published as far back as 2009 and later watched morph into the list that Rehm eventually picked up this week.\n\nClearly, Vick has been tracking this phenomenon for awhile.\n\nSo, when the rest of the people who heard Rehm ask Sanders about his Israeli citizenship was scratching their heads about where she got her information, Vick was sighing in resignation. Here we go again.\n\nIn her apology, Rehm said she's glad that in making this mistake, she put that rumor to rest. Here's the full statement:\n\nOn yesterday\u2019s show, I raised the issue of dual citizenship with Senator and Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders. This is an issue that has come up over the years in American politics. One of our listeners suggested via our Facebook page that I ask Senator Sanders about Internet speculation that he has dual citizenship with Israel.\n\nBut instead of asking it as a question I stated it as fact. That was wrong. He does NOT have dual citizenship and Senator Sanders immediately corrected me. I should have explained to him and to you why I felt this was a relevant question and something he might like to address. I apologize to Senator Sanders and to you for having made an erroneous statement. However, I am glad to play a role in putting this rumor to rest.\n\nBut that's a myth, too, Vick said. People will keep spinning American Jewish leaders' alliances for as long as they have points to prove about Israel. It's human nature.\n\n\"We're all looking for validation of whatever we believe, and that includes people in the extremist community as well,\" he said. \"So they latch onto something that they perceive to be a truth even though there's a flaw in the logic and run with it.\"\n\nWould you include Rehm in that category?\n\nVick: \"We expect more from journalists. You just shake your head and you just say, 'Why? How?'\"\n\nLike we said, that's a whole other story.\n\nJustin Moyer contributed to this report.\n\nAmber Phillips writes about politics for The Fix. She was previously the one-woman D.C. bureau for the Las Vegas Sun and has reported from Boston and Taiwan.\n\nA:",

Movie title: Girls Just Want to Have Fun Context: Janey Glenn is an army brat who is thrilled when her father, Robert, is transferred to Chicago, the home of her favorite dance show Dance TV. At her Catholic girls school, she quickly makes a new friend in Lynne Stone due to their shared love of dance and Dance TV. When Robert nixes the idea of her traveling to downtown Chicago to try out, Janey accompanies Lynne to the auditions. At the auditions, an enemy is made of spoiled rich girl Natalie Sands when she rudely parks her car where Lynne is walking. The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner gets her cut (it is later found out that Natalie paid him to have her kicked out). Janey and a dreamboat named Jeff both shine, albeit partnered with others at first. They are later paired once the final cut is made. Jeff loves to dance although his father is drilling him to go to trade school and is following his heart instead of his father's wishes. The two butt heads initially due to their disparate upbringings. Despite Jeff's natural ability to dance, he has never taken a class. Janey has been taking both gymnastics and dance classes for ten years. Helping them to get off on the wrong foot is also Janey's inability to practice when it's convenient for Jeff. Things are further complicated by Natalie's meddling (she finds out that Janey skipped choir practice to meet Jeff and calls her father to tell, posing as \"Sister Natalie\"). An excellent opportunity for both girls to get back at Natalie presents itself when Jeff is invited to her coming out party.

Movie title: The Lovely Bones Context: In 1973, 14-year-old Susie Salmon dreams about becoming a photographer. One day, Ray, a boy she has a crush on, approaches her at school and asks her out. As Susie walks home through a cornfield, she runs into her neighbor, George Harvey, who coaxes her into his underground den. Inside, Susie becomes uncomfortable and attempts to leave; when he grabs her, the scene fades until she is seen rushing past classmate Ruth Connors, apparently fleeing Harvey's den. The Salmons become worried when Susie fails to return home from school. Her father, Jack, searches for her, while her mother, Abigail, waits for the police. In town, Susie sees Jack, but he does not respond to her when she calls. Susie runs home to find Harvey soaking in a bathtub. After seeing her bracelet hanging on the sink faucet near a bloody shaving razor, Susie realizes she never escaped the den and was murdered by Harvey. Screaming, she is pulled into the \"In-Between\", that is neither Heaven nor Earth. From there, Susie watches over her loved ones, unable to let go despite the urging of her new afterlife friend, Holly. Investigating Susie's disappearance with Detective Fenerman, Jack thinks Susie was murdered by someone she knew. He researches neighbors and comes to think Harvey is the killer. Fenerman is unable to find any evidence pinpointing Harvey as a suspect, as Harvey cleaned up. Susie's sister, Lindsey, agrees with Jack's suspicions, but their casework takes a toll on Abigail, and Jack invites Abigail's alcoholic mother, Lynn, to move in with them. Feeling alienated from her husband, Abigail leaves for California. Susie, in her afterlife, learns that Harvey, who has now targeted Lindsey as his next victim, has murdered six other girls, including Holly, and that he stuffed Susie's body into a safe in his basement. One night, Jack, carrying a bat, trails Harvey into the cornfield. However, Jack accidentally stumbles across Susie's friend, Clarissa. Her boyfriend, who mistakenly thinks his girlfriend is being assaulted, nearly bludgeons Jack...\n----\nAnswer: Ray\n\n\nQuestion: Which is the other Name of planet Mars?

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1881, Edgar Rice Burroughs attends the funeral of his uncle, John Carter, a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain, who died suddenly. The body is put in a tomb unlockable only from the inside. The attorney executing the will hands Burroughs Carter's journal, which he reads, hoping to find clues about Carter's death and the reason he is the willed heir. The bulk of the film enacts what Burroughs reads. While prospecting in the Arizona Territory in 1868, just after the Civil War, Carter is arrested by Union Colonel Powell, who seeks his help in fighting the Apache and insists that Carter owes it to his country. Carter refuses, stating that any debt was paid when he lost his family. Carter escapes from his cell but is pursued by Powell and his cavalry. After encountering a band of Apaches, Carter and the wounded Powell take refuge in a cave, which turns out to be the object of Carter's earlier search: the \"Spider Cave of Gold\". A mysterious priestly being, a Thern, appears in the cave at that moment, and surprised by Carter's presence, immediately attacks him with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern's powerful medallion, and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of Barsoom, later revealed to be Mars. Due to Barsoom's low gravity and his own relatively high bone density, Carter is able to perform incredible jumps and feats of strength. He is captured by the Tharks, a clan of four-armed Green Martians led by their \"Jeddak\" (chieftain), Tars Tarkas. Tars instructs Sola to watch over Carter, leading to her feeding him a liquid that enables him to understand the Martians' language. Elsewhere on Barsoom, the human Red Martian city of Helium, led by Thardos Mors, and the Walking City of Zodanga, led by the villainous Sab Than (Dominic West),...\n----\nAnswer:",

Here are the steps to do this for your example of allowing the user \"josh\" to use `systemctl start/stop/status` without a password:\n\n1. Open a terminal and log in as the root user or a user with sudo privileges.\n\n2. Type the following command to open the sudoers file in the terminal-based text editor nano:\n\n```\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/josh\n```\nThis command will open a new sudoers file named \"josh\" in the `/etc/sudoers.d/` directory. This is the recommended way to add custom sudoers rules, as it keeps them separate from the main sudoers file.\n\n3. In the nano editor, add the following line:\n\n```\njosh ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/systemctl start, /usr/bin/systemctl stop, /usr/bin/systemctl status\n```\nThis line allows the user \"josh\" to run the `start`, `stop`, and `status` sub-commands of the `systemctl` command without being prompted for a password. The `NOPASSWD:` option specifies that no password is required.\n\n4. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl+O` and then exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+X`.\n\n5. Verify that the syntax of the sudoers file is correct by running the following command:\n\n```\nsudo visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.d/josh\n```\nIf there are any syntax errors in the file, this command will report them.\n\nNow the user \"josh\" can use `sudo systemctl start/stop/status` without being prompted for a password."

Convenience: Team members can view and edit the attached file directly from the Task Board, which saves time and eliminates the need to switch between different apps or programs.\n3. Security: By attaching the file directly to the card, team members can ensure that sensitive or confidential information is not shared with unauthorized individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, including a link on the card that points to the file has the following advantages:\n\n1. Space-saving: Including a link on the card instead of attaching a large file directly to the card can help save space on the Task Board.\n2. Version control: By linking to a cloud-based file, team members can ensure that everyone is working on the most up-to-date version of the file.\n3. Collaboration: By linking to a file stored in a cloud-based service, such as OneDrive or SharePoint, team members can collaborate on the file in real-time, which can help improve efficiency and productivity.\n\nUltimately, the decision to attach a file to a card versus including a link on the card that points to the file depends on the specific needs of the team and the nature of the file in question."

    "input": "",
    "output": "Whether it is better to invest in an ETF or a mutual fund for tax purposes depends on several factors and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.\n\nETFs and mutual funds are similar in that they are both pools of investments that allow individual investors to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to a broad range of assets. However, there are some differences between the two that can impact their tax implications.\n\nOne key difference is the way that ETFs and mutual funds are traded. ETFs are traded on an exchange like stocks, whereas mutual funds are bought and sold through the fund company at the end of the trading day at the net asset value (NAV) price. This can impact the taxes you pay on your investment.\n\nWhen you sell shares of an ETF, you may owe capital gains tax on any profit you've made, just as you would if you sold individual stocks. With mutual funds, you may owe capital gains tax when you sell shares, but you may also owe taxes on any capital gains that the fund has realized and passed through to investors, even if you didn't sell any of your shares. This is known as a capital gains distribution.\n\nAnother consideration is the tax efficiency of the funds. ETFs are generally more tax-efficient than mutual funds because they are structured in a way that minimizes the amount of taxable events that occur. For example, when an ETF investor sells their shares, the ETF can simply hand over the shares of the underlying stocks, rather than having to sell the stocks and generate capital gains.\n\nIn summary, whether it is better to invest in an ETF or a mutual fund for tax purposes depends on your individual circumstances and investment goals. If tax efficiency is a key consideration, ETFs may be a better choice, but it's always best to consult a financial advisor or tax professional to determine what is best for you."

He stopped periodically to admire the beauty of the lake, the crystal-clear blue water rippling as the sun shined down on it, the little yellow ducks swimming merrily all around. He couldn\u2019t help but smile; the lake was so peaceful and it had a calming effect on him. He watched as a family of geese flew over the lake and landed smoothly on the water, and he let out a content sigh, grateful for the momentary escape from his troubles. \n\nAs he continued on his stroll, Dan thought about all the memories he had made in the area, memories of playing at the park with his friends when he was younger, of swimming and fishing in the lake with his family, of sipping ice-cold lemonades on picnic blankets on warm summer days. He remembered the berry patches he and his friends used to pick and how they would have berry pie for dinner that evening. He smiled again. \n\nHe continued walking, this time more slowly, savoring every moment, the scent of the crisp autumn air filling his lungs. He passed by the creek where he and his friends had built a wooden bridge when they were kids, and soon he realized that he had come full circle. He said goodbye to the lake, grateful for its beauty and serenity, and made his way home, his cares long forgotten."

For example, you could use the following code to create a nested `for_each` loop:\n```\nmodule \"example\" {\n  for_each = var.outer_collection\n\n  # Nested resource that uses the outer loop's iterator value\n  resource \"example_resource\" \"nested\" {\n    for_each = var.inner_collection\n\n    # Use the values from both loops in the resource's configuration\n    # You can access the outer loop's iterator value using\n    # the \"each.key\" syntax, and the inner loop's iterator value\n    # using the \"each.value\" syntax\n    name = \"${each.key}-${each.value}\"\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `module` block's `for_each` argument specifies the outer collection to loop over, and the `resource` block's `for_each` argument specifies the inner collection to loop over. The resource configuration then uses the values from both loops to create a unique name for each resource instance."

It can refer to a wide range of artworks, including digital art, paintings, sculptures, and installations, that are created with the help of AI algorithms, machine learning models, and other AI technologies.\n\nThere are several ways that AI can be used to create art. One common approach is to use AI algorithms to generate images or videos based on certain parameters or inputs. For example, an artist might use an AI model that has been trained on a dataset of images to generate a new image that resembles a particular style or subject. Another approach is to use AI to augment the creative process, such as by suggesting ideas or providing feedback on the artistic direction of a project.\n\nAI art is often seen as a blend of technology and creativity, and it has the potential to open up new possibilities for artists to explore and express themselves. However, it has also raised questions about the role of technology in the creative process and the extent to which AI can be considered \"creative\" in its own right."

They work alongside each other in various industries, from manufacturing, to healthcare and hospitality. In daily life, you can see robots performing tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and running errands. They have become an integral part of modern society, making everyday life easier and more efficient.\n\nIn this world, robots are equipped with sophisticated artificial intelligence, allowing them to think, learn, and adapt in ways similar to humans. They have become more advanced than ever, with the ability to communicate and interact with humans, understand social norms, and even express emotions. Some high-end robots are virtually indistinguishable from humans.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of the coexistence of humans and robots is the increased productivity and efficiency that it brings. Tasks that were previously time-consuming or hazardous can now be completed with ease, and complex problems can be solved more quickly with the combined brainpower of humans and robots. In healthcare, for example, robots can assist with surgeries, provide care for the elderly, and monitor patients' health.\n\nThis future world has its challenges as well, such as the integration of robots into society and the potential for widespread job automation. However, with careful planning and foresight, humanity has embraced the coexistence with robots and worked to ensure that it is a positive and mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nIn summary, this future world where robots and humans coexist is one of technological progress, increased efficiency, and a new era of collaboration between man and machine."

I just wish they could be more adjustable. There are No instructions other than a picture overview on the back of the package.

    "input": "",
    "output": "The question of the meaning of life is one that has puzzled philosophers and theologians for centuries. It is a question that is difficult to answer definitively, as the answer will vary depending on one's personal beliefs and values. However, there are a few different approaches that one can take when trying to understand the meaning of life.\n\nOne approach to understanding the meaning of life is through the lens of religion. Many religious traditions offer a belief in an afterlife or a higher power that gives meaning to life on earth. For example, some people may believe that the purpose of life is to follow the teachings of their religion and live a virtuous life in order to achieve a positive afterlife. Others may believe that the meaning of life is to serve and worship a higher power, or to fulfill a specific purpose or mission that has been ordained by that higher power.\n\nAnother approach to understanding the meaning of life is through the pursuit of happiness. Some people believe that the purpose of life is to seek happiness and to find fulfillment and satisfaction in life. This might involve pursuing personal goals and passions, developing meaningful relationships with others, and finding ways to contribute to the greater good.\n\nA third approach to understanding the meaning of life is through the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Some people believe that the meaning of life is to learn and grow as individuals, to expand our knowledge and understanding of the world around us, and to use this knowledge to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of life is something that each individual must determine for themselves based on their own beliefs, values, and experiences. There is no one \"right\" answer to this question, and what gives meaning and purpose to one person's life may be different for another. However, by considering different approaches and perspectives, we can gain a deeper understanding of what gives our lives meaning and purpose."

If the tree is currently 10 feet tall, what would be the tree's total height after 4 months (assuming each month is 4 weeks long)?\nLet's think: Since a month has four weeks, the tree will increase its height by 2 feet for 4 * 4 = 16 weeks after four months of growing. Since the tree grows at 2 feet per week, after 16 weeks, the tree would have increased its height by 2 * 16 = 32 feet. If the tree is currently 10 feet tall, its height after four months will be 10 + 32 = 42 feet.. The answer is: 42.\n\nJimmy needs to score at least 50 points to pass to the next class.

For bad behavior, he lost 5 points, so he has 60 \u2013 5 = 55 points left. To pass to the next class, Jimmy needs at least 50 points, so he can lose 55 \u2013 50 = 5 more points..

The edger works very well along sidewalks where you can use the edge of the concrete as a guide. The edger requires a bit more \"skill\" though when you try to edge a flower bed or around trees. I think two things are required: (1) a steady hand and (2) DRY soil. It definitely bogs down a little in wet soil and it is harder to control. The first time you use it in an area that has not been edged before, it is a little difficult to use. But using the edger to maintain a previously edged area is a snap! Overall I am *very* happy with this purchase. Is the review positive or negative?\nPositive\n------\nTitle: not worth it Review: I wish this had been better but I don't think it is worth the money. The large size makes it difficult for little hands to manage, the delete button is annoying, the picture quality is terrible - forget flash photography. I'm sure you could buy a real digital camera for this price and at least be able to share and talk about the photos with your kids. It sounds good but my advice is to skip it and look for something else. Is the review positive or negative?\nNegative\n------\nTitle: pulls hair doesn't cut Review: Beware. This trimmer is PAINFUL and completely ineffective. Do not waste your time and money. It is not eligible for return and you WILL want to return it.. Cheaply made gimicky waste of money. Suck it up and ask a friend to trim your back. Is the review positive or negative?\nNegative\n------\nTitle: AC adapter for T61: 42T5008 Review: Today I saw the break in the cable. Just as everyone describes it - it is just below the grey jack (the base) that plugs into the laptop. I don't know if I am relieved to know that it is not only me experiencing this.

Override the `onStartCommand()` method, which is called when the service is started. This is where you will put the code for the service's main functionality.\n3. In the `onStartCommand()` method, return one of the constants from the `START_STICKY`, `START_NOT_STICKY`, or `START_REDELIVER_INTENT` to indicate how the service should be started.\n4. In the `onCreate()` method, you can initialize any resources needed by the service.\n5. To start the service, you can use the `startService()` method in an activity or broadcast receiver, and pass in an Intent that specifies the service to start.\n6. To stop the service, you can use the `stopService()` method, and pass in an Intent that specifies the service to stop.\n\nExample code:\n```\npublic class MyService extends Service {\n    @Override\n    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {\n        // Code for service's main functionality\n        return START_STICKY;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate();\n        // Initialize resources here\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\nIntent serviceIntent = new Intent(this, MyService.class);\nstartService(serviceIntent);\n```\nNote that, this is just a basic example and you might need to add additional logic and error handling in your actual implementation."

    "input": "",
    "output": "A hair dryer is a common household item used to dry wet hair by blowing hot air over it. The hair dryer functions in the following way:\n\n1. When you plug in the hairdryer and switch it on, electricity flows into the device and into a component known as the heating element. The heating element, which is often made up of nichrome wire, is a resistor that resists the flow of electricity, thereby producing heat.\n\n2. The hairdryer also has a fan, consisting of small blades,  that is powered by an electric motor. When the hairdryer is powered on, the motor begins to spin, causing the fan to rotate. As the fan rotates, it draws in air from the vents at the back of the hairdryer.\n\n3. The air passes over the hot heating element, gets warmed up, and is then blown out of the front nozzle. \n\n4. In this way, hot air is continuously produced and blown out of the hairdryer, reducing the amount of moisture in the hair.\n\nMost hair dryers also have a cool air setting which blows unheated air from the fan allowing you to set the style you've made with the hot air. \n\nHair dryers also contain safety features such as a thermal fuse which can shut the dryer off if it gets too hot, preventing burns and other hazards from over-heating."

Lisez un C.S Lewis (Narnia), un Tolkien (Le Hobbit, le Seigneur des Anneaux, Le Silmarillion), ou encore un Rowling (H.Potter). On en ressort autrement grandi. Ce n'est pas pour rien si Tolkien \u00e9tait titulaire de la Chaire de Litt\u00e9rature Anglaise d'Oxford, et que Lewis y enseignait !  Une banale r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration.

    "input": "",
    "output": "Hoarding money is a behavior that can stem from a variety of underlying factors. It is common for people to want to save money in order to have a sense of financial security and to protect themselves from unforeseen expenses. However, excessive hoarding of money can sometimes be driven by other psychological factors.\n\nOne reason people may hoard money is a fear of the future. They may worry about potential job loss, economic downturns, or other unexpected events that could affect their financial stability. Keeping large sums of money saved can provide a sense of comfort that they have a safety net in case of future challenges.\n\nAnother reason people may hoard money relates to their upbringing and past experiences. Some people may have grown up in households that struggled financially and as a result, they have learned to live frugally and save as much as possible. Others may have experienced financial hardship in the past leading to feelings of anxiety around money and a desire to avoid repeating past mistakes.\n\nPeople may also hoard money as a form of control. Money can represent power, status and independence. By holding onto it and accumulating large sums, people may feel like they are in control of their lives, especially in other areas where they may feel powerless or vulnerable.\n\nIn some cases, hoarding money can be a symptom of underlying mental health conditions, such as anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People with these conditions may have intense anxieties around spending money and may feel the need to save excessively, leading to hoarding behaviors.\n\nIn summary, people hoard money for a variety of reasons, ranging from a desire for financial security to underlying psychological factors. The motivations for hoarding money can vary greatly from person to person, and in some cases, may require professional help to manage."

How much money does a restaurant make on a bottle of spirits?\nAnswer: There are 16 servings in 1 bottle and they charge $8.00 per serving so that's 16 * 8 = $128.00. 1 bottle yields $128.00 and they spent $30.00 for the bottle so they make 128 - 30 = $98.00 on each bottle. The answer is 98.\n[Question]Jolene wants to raise some money to buy a bicycle. She babysits for 4 families for $30 each. She also washes 5 neighbors\u2019 cars for $12 each.

When he gets to the office, the secretary takes another 4 out of the box when he's not looking. Lastly, right before the meeting Bill sets the box down on his desk and leaves the office to take a phone call. While Bill's away, his coworkers steal half the remaining donuts. Bill comes back and brings the box into his meeting. How many donuts are left in the box?\nA: Bill eats 2 donuts out of a box of 50 for 50 - 2 = 48 donuts remaining. The secretary takes 4 more donuts out of the box, leaving 44 donuts remaining. Bills coworkers take half of the remaining donuts, leaving 44 / 2 = 22 donuts remaining. The answer is 22.\nQuestion: If Tony normally has a temperature of 95 degrees, and he comes down with a sickness that raises his temperature by 10 degrees, how many degrees above the threshold of fever is his temperature if a fever is anything over 100 degrees?\nAnswer: First, we find what Tony's temperature is by adding his normal temperature of 95 to the increase in temperature from the sickness of 10, performing 95 + 10 = 105 degrees. Since the threshold for having a fever is 100, we subtract 100 from 105 to find out the answer, performing 105 - 100 = 5 degrees above a fever. The answer is 5.\n[Question]At the duck park, there are 25 mallard ducks and ten less than twice as many geese as ducks. Then, a small flock of 4 ducks arrived at the park and joined the birds already there. If five less than 15 geese leave the park, how many more geese than ducks remain at the park?\n[Answer]Initially, twice as many geese as ducks is 25 * 2 = 50 geese. Therefore, ten less than twice as many geese as ducks is 50 - 10 = 40 geese. Then, 4 ducks arrived at the park, resulting in 25 + 4 = 29 ducks. Five less than 15 geese is 15 - 5 = 10 geese. Thus, if 5 less than 15 geese leave, then 40 - 10 = 30 geese remain. Thus, there are 30 - 29 = 1 more geese than ducks remaining at the park. The answer is 1.\n[Question]Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin.

    "output": "Since Peter reads three times as fast as Kristin, Kristin will take 18 * 3 = 54 hours to read one book. Kristin reads half of her books, a total of 20 / 2 = 10 books. The time Kristin will take to read half of her books is 10 * 54 = 540. The answer is 540."

    "instruction": "Q: Brinley's teacher took the grade six students to the San Diego Zoo to watch and learn about animals. While at the zoo, Brinley counted 100 snakes, 80 arctic foxes, and 20 leopards. She also saw ten times more bee-eaters than leopards, half as many cheetahs as snakes, and twice as many alligators as the total number of Arctic foxes and leopards. What's the total number of animals Brinley counted at the zoo?\nA: There were 10 * 20 = 200 more bee - eaters at the zoo. There were 1 / 2 * 100 = 50 cheetahs. The total number of foxes and leopards is 80 + 20 = 100. There were 2 * 100 = 200 alligators. The total number of animals is 200 alligators + 220 bee - eaters + 100 snakes + 80 tactic foxes + 20 leopards + 50 cheetahs = 670 animals. The answer is 670.\nQuestion: Susan is picking strawberries. She's trying to fill her basket, but out of every handful of 5 strawberries she can't help but eat one of them herself. If her basket holds 60 strawberries, how many berries will she actually pick before she fills it?\nAnswer: Out of every 5 berries, she eats 1, so only 5 strawberries - 1 strawberry = 4 strawberries go into the basket for each handful. The basket holds 60 strawberries, so it will take 60 strawberries / 4 strawberries per handful = 15 handfuls to fill the basket. So in total, Susan will pick 60 strawberries + 15 handfuls * 1 strawberry eaten per handful = 75 strawberries. The answer is 75.\n[Question]Melany has to fence a 5000 feet square field with wire mesh. If one foot of wire mesh is sold at $30, and she had $120000, how many feet of the field will not be fenced?\n[Answer]Since one - foot wire mesh is sold at $30, with $120000, Melany can buy $120000 / $30 = 4000 feet of wire mesh. If Melany has to fence 5000 feet of the field and has 4000 feet of wire mesh, she will not fence 5000 - 4000 = 1000 feet of the field. The answer is 1000.\nQ: Eric has 4 ninja throwing stars. His friend Chad has twice as many. Then Jeff bought 2 ninja stars from Chad. Jeff now has 6 throwing stars. How many ninja throwing stars do they have altogether?\nA: We know Eric has 4 stars and Chad has twice that amount, so Chad has 4 x 2 = 8 stars. Then Chad sells 2 of them to Jeff, so Chad has 8 \u2013 2 = 6 stars. Altogether, Eric has 4 + Chad has 6 + Jeff has 6 = 16 stars. The answer is 16.\nQuestion: One logger can cut down 6 trees per day. The forest is a rectangle measuring 4 miles by 6 miles, and each square mile has 600 trees. If there are 30 days in each month, how many months will it take 8 loggers to cut down all the trees?\nAnswer: First find the total area of the forest: 4 miles * 6 miles = 24 square miles. Then find the total number of trees in that area: 600 trees / square mile * 24 square miles = 14400 trees. Then find the number of trees all the loggers can cut down in one day: 8 loggers * 6 trees / logger = 48 trees. Then divide the total number of trees by the number cut down per day to find the number of days it takes to clear the forest: 14400 trees / 48 trees / day = 300 days. Then divide the time in days by the number of days per month to find the time in months: 300 days / 30 days / month = 10 months. The answer is 10.\nQ: Milton has some books about zoology and 4 times as many books about botany. If he has 80 books total, how many zoology books does he have?\nA:",
